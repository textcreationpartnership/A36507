            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93369:3"/> of the Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould have all and onely thoſe Diagno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſignes that practical Authors have delivered, and that the Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or Obſtruction muſt be juſt ſo and ſuch a one as they have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                  <p>Alſo for the Cure: When the young Practitioner reads ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine will cure, or ſuch a Receipt never fails, or by this or that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod 20 have been cured, he imagines he can cure all, and that ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are certain Cures, and ſuch a method is a like ſucceſsful in all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and that a Jaundice, Dropſie, Cough, Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is juſt one and the ſame in all Perſons, and therefore as he expects all perſons to have ſuch, all ſuch, no more nor no other ſigns, cauſes, nor prognoſticks of their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſuch a particular Diſeaſe, than what Authors have one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet down in their Practices of Phyſick; ſo alſo the Cure he expects to be the ſame in all: as for Example: He may read in <hi>Jo.

We mention onely theſe for Example, for a thouſand ſuch may be ſeen in Authors; and when the young Practitioner reads them, he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conceive he muſt, as theſe write, cure all ſuch Diſeaſes by ſuch Medicines or Methods; but he ſhall be deceived: yet often ſuch Cures have been; but Authors have deceived, by not telling how oft ſuch a Medicine hath failed, as well as how oft it hath cured: for there is no Medicine in uſe, but hath cured ſome, and there is none ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93369:3"/> as to cure all; nor are all Diſeaſes, though never ſo ſlight, curable; nor are all diſeaſes, though never ſo dangerous and grievous, always and in all incurable.</p>
                  <p>Can did Reader, It is my zealous deſire to Truth that thou ſhouldeſt really and truly underſtand all theſe things, and when thou readeſt any Author know thereby how to judge of them: For the Moderns, who come nigher to Truth in their Practices of Phyſick, than the Ancients, or <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> are very much miſled. I chiefly commend <hi>Felix Platerus</hi> in his Practice of Phyſick, who followed his own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Obſervations, though his own Experience was inſufficient to demonſtrate the Truth, all the Truth, and nothing but the Truth, in all Diſeaſes. I have been much troubled to ſee how ſuperſtitiouſly Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have been led by the Traditition of <hi>Galen, Hippocrates, Etius, Aegineta,</hi> and Others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For their Names given to Diſeaſes, therein was much diſorder: Some they called from the Cauſe, others from the Effects or Symptoms; ſome they called Obſtructions or Scirrhs, or Inflamations of the Liver, Spleen or Lungs, thoſe were denominated from the Cauſe; ſome they called Swounding, Panting of the Heart, Epilepſie, Convulſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe were ſo called from the apparant affliction or outward appearance, whenas the cauſe of each of theſe Symptoms or Effects was various, Phyſicians having reckoned ſo many Diſeaſes of the Lungs, as a Cough, Phthiſick, Pleuriſie, ſpitting of Blood, Empyema, or ſpitting of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Peripneumonia and Aſthma; divers Phyſicians reading them, will think, as formerly they have, (for ſo it is beſt judging what will be, by what hath been) that every Diſeaſe of the Lungs is one of theſe, and that the Lungs can be affected in no other manner than in one of theſe Diſeaſes; and in that Diſeaſe, ſo for Order and Meaſure as Authors have in their Practices of Phyſick deſcribed: How great an Errour and Miſtake is it in the generality of Practical Phyſicians coming to a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if they finde it a Diſeaſe of the Lungs preſently to conclude it one of thoſe Phyſicians have writ Chapters of? As, If it be not an Empye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, it muſt be a Phthyſick; if it be not the Phthyſick or Conſumption of the Lungs, it is an Aſthma; if it be not reckonable as an Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, it muſt be proceeded againſt in cure, by the directions in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Coughs; if none of theſe, then it muſt be Haemoptoe, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red juſt as the Practical Chapters of Haemoptoe direct: Nature runs not in theſe Orders, Nature is not bound up to ſuch Rules, we ſhall hardly finde two in any one Diſeaſe exactly alike; yet thoſe that have exquiſite Pleuriſies do the moſt concur in Symptoms of any Diſeaſes I know, nor are the Cauſes of an Empyema, Haemoptoe, Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hiſis, Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93369:4"/> Aſthma, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch and ſo many, no more, nor no others than what Practical Phyſicians have writ; but there be many Cauſes, and diverſe from thoſe the Ancients eſpecially took notice of, to produce the Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes they write; and conſequently the Signs, Prognoſticks and Cure muſt vary, where the Cauſes do ſo vary, Nature not running in that Method as the Ancients, and alſo the Moderns, dancing after their Pipes, have imagined.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the Definition of Diſeaſes: In ſome Bodies and in ſome Diſeaſes accidentally they may prove exactly true, but for the moſt part they do not: for where there are ſuch difference of Diſeaſes that they can neither properly be called one or another that are writ down in Practices, and where the Cauſes in each Diſeaſe may be ſo contrary and manifold, it will neceſſarily follow, the Signs much vary, and there is the Definition chiefly grounded on the cauſe and ſigns, the Fonndation of any thing being infirm or corrupted, the Superſtructure muſt needs be infirm and inſtable: but I ſay accidentally, in ſome Diſeaſes, in ſome Bodies at ſome times, we may meet with an exact coherence of the definition of that Diſeaſe with the Parties caſe, which being the ſuming up of the Diſeaſe, and the moſt general and chief cauſes and ſigns that happen to moſt in that Diſeaſe, it is much (if Nature did go to a Rule, and was bound up to a Method) ſo few ſhould be found (amongſt many ſick perſons that have Diſeaſes) correſpondent exactly to the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Practices of Phyſick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Cauſes of Diſeaſes: Phyſicians went huge conjecturally to work, and gueſſed by outward appearances what muſt be inward, and by the Effect they did judge the Cauſe, the contrary to which, is the way to finde out Truth; they did not uſe to anatomize and ſee the wonderful variety there is in dead Bodies, and how Nature follows no Method in Diſeaſes: As for inſtance, In Diſeaſes of the Heart, the Ancients, and ſo recent Authors, have ſet down two, <hi>viz.</hi> Swounding and Palpitation, now Experience hath found thorough Diffection, that Side-pains, Baſtard-Pleuriſies, Gripings, Aguiſh diſtempers, Symptoms of Worms, Symptoms of ill Digeſtion, and <hi>Singultus,</hi> &amp;c. do ariſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the Heart, as well as Vicine parts; and Experience hath fully ſhewn that the Heart is not affected as the Ancients thought com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and moſt often; yet this we ſhall allow the Ancients and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns that have followed unqueſtioned Tradition, that the Heart is ſometimes affected with one or more of thoſe cauſes they attribute to it, and the more in caſual and intermitting Diſtempers of it, but in confirmed Diſtempers of the Heart, or the ſame will hold of all the other Bowels, onely we inſtance in one; the cauſes were Ulcers, or

The Ancients were apparantly out; to write onely of the Diſeaſe of the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder, and ſo for the place and kinds of Worms; there is no peculiarity in the Kidneys or Bladder to have the Stone, they are frequently found in the Gall, Stomack, Lungs, Head, Liver, Uterus, and Joynts, and outward parts: and thoſe things that are generated in the outward Fleſh, as Spots, Tubercles, Boils, Carnous Excreſcences, Struma's, Glandula's, Worms, Stones, Phly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctenae, Bladders of Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are alſo frequently found in the inward Bowels.

                  <p>What ſhall we ſay? doth Nature proceed in no Method, or Order, or Coherence in cauſing Diſeaſes? Yes, there is ſome, but not as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages have generally ſuppoſed; it is the ſpirit and quality of that ſpirit in every living, moving, and growing Being, that is the Cauſe, and wherein is the Method; and the Stars, principally the Planets and Moon, by the Air, alter the quality of the Humours in our Body, and thence comes ſuch variety in our Bodies: but yet if the Inward Cauſe in our Bodies comply not with the Outward, there is nothing done; the quality of the Air by its ſeeds ſown in our Humours or Blood, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutes or changes them into the nature of the Seeds, the Blood findes a matter in it whoſe Spirit is of a quality Heterogenious and Heteropa the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical to the Blood, and ſo works to throw off its Enemy; and in the Pox, Meaſles, Plague, and Purples, it throws off that Heterogenious matter by the Skin, Pores, or Habit of the <hi>Body;</hi> but where the matter in the <hi>Blood</hi> is not ſo venemous, or exceeding adverſe qualited to our Nature, the Veins throw it off on ſome part: for in the <hi>Body</hi> like draws like to it, as in the Earth, and Terrene Things, and puts off or ſeparates any matter that is of a quality adverſe or contrary to the <hi>Blood</hi> and Nature of the Spirits conſtituting our vitality: Now we ſee Water in the <hi>Blood,</hi> ſometimes thicker, ſometimes thinner, ſometimes limpid, ſometimes oleaginous, ſometimes yellow, ſometimes black, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet becauſe this Humour hath not a quality Heterogenious to the <hi>Blood,</hi> it reſts very well in the <hi>Blood,</hi> and is not endeavoured by Nature to be caſt off, nor cauſes any Diſeaſe, for a thing that looks exactly as another, may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it in nature, ſo <hi>Sperma Humanum,</hi> and ſome glutinous and thick Flegm we raiſe from our Lungs or Palate of our Mouth, look ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly alike, and are in conſiſtence the ſame; and yet there is a Spirit of an enlivening nature in the <hi>Sperma Humanum,</hi> and onely a cold ſtupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

So in the <hi>Body of Man,</hi> if we could ſee the Humours and affected Parts, and the current of the <hi>Blood,</hi> we could not tell whether People would live or die of thoſe Diſtempers, or how they would change, or what they would become for the moſt part: for an Humour looking like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an abſceſs of the Liver, Spleen, Reins, or Lungs, ſhall not raiſe Symptoms alike, nor work alike, becauſe the quality that is in it, alters it and works it; in one abſceſs there is a petrifying quality, and that turns all the matter in a little time into perfect ſtone, one or many; in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abſceſs, Ulcer, Apoſthume or Tubercle of any of theſe <hi>Bowels,</hi> the matter looking the ſame with the former, is a vivifying ſpirit, and that matter takes ſome or other ſtrange and commonly different form, and enlivens and increaſes; another Abſceſs hath a matter like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but in this is an Earthy Gummy Spirit, and inſipid, and this turns all the matter into a Caruncle or Fungus, or if it be a little otherwiſe qualified, a Glandule, or many Kernels; in another Abſceſs is a fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting qualitied ſpirit, and that makes them Aguiſh, and this differs hugely in quality <hi>inter ſe;</hi> for ſome fermentative matter is colder and duller, becauſe it wants the ſharp and hot ſpirit that is in other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and this cauſeth colder Agues; the ſharper and hotter the ſpirit in this matter is, the hotter is the Ague: therefore many times they that drink much ſtrong-Water make a cold Ague all hot Fits. Again, this matter differs in the peculiarity of the quality, ſome fermenting twice in one day, ſome once in twenty four hours, ſome once in two days, and ſome but once in three or four days: In another Excrementitious Matter is an Oſſifick quality, and then a Bone is generated of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſhape with the Excrementitious Matter, for the Oſſifick Spirit tranſmutes it as it lies; even as our Wells in <hi>England,</hi> and Earth about <hi>Shefford,</hi> turns the Wood into perfect Stone in the ſame figure it was; and ſo a few Grains of <hi>Ens Auri,</hi> or Eſſence of Gold, tranſmutes much Lead or Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now ſuch a Method doth Nature obſerve, that it is the caſual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Planets (ſimply, or conjoyned with fixed Stars of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Magnitudes, that are milde or gentle-natured) upon our <hi>Blood</hi> and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and as the quantity and quality of our <hi>Blood</hi> and Humours vary, ſo the Stars act variouſly: for the Agent can do nothing, if the Patient is not fit; and one Planet doth not ſo powerfully alter one mans <hi>Body</hi> as anothers, becauſe in one it was his Significator at his Nativity, in the other a Significator of his Fortune, in another a Significator of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at his Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome matter, a greater proneneſs and aptitude to petrify; in other, to oſſify; in other, to vivify or animate; in other, to carnify; in other, to ſanguify; in other, to lactify; in other, to ſpermafy and crinify: and though the greater number of Planets that are ſtongeſt at ſuch a time, do diſpoſe the Humours to putrify or vermify, (for at ſometimes both old Folks and Children have Worms more than in other ſeaſons) yet in all <hi>Bodies</hi> there be not thoſe Humours; and in all <hi>Bodies</hi> that thoſe Humours be, yet there is not in them a like putrifying quality: At ſuch a time <hi>Venus</hi> is Lady of the Aſcendant, commands <hi>Jupiter, Mars,</hi> the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in her Houſe, is ſtrongeſt of any in the Scheam, and yet all men at this time are not Veneriouſly inclined, for ſome are never libidinous; yet at this time they may be more libidinous than others; and at ſuch a time an evil-minded men is the likelier to accompliſh his inceſtuous Deſires. VVe ſee huge mutations and changes dayly and hourly, ſometimes in ſome ſick perſons, and how do theſe come, but from the motion of the Morbifick Cauſe? and how is that changed and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo ſtrangely, but by the Attoms in the Air, drawn into our <hi>Body</hi> in our <hi>Breath,</hi> which are qualified from the Planets?</p>

Concerning the alteration of Diſeaſes, changing of Symptoms, and of all diſeaſed Parts, dying and growing ſick, it is apparantly ſeen in ſome Diſeaſes by the alteration of the Moon, and divers have told me, That when the Plague did rage in this Town of <hi>Hitchin,</hi> moſt fell ſick or died at change of the Moon, or full Moon, and four or five were buried then together, and when the Moon was at her full ſtate, was the ſickneſs in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Moreover the monthly Fluxes of Women, or Menſtrues, are cauſed partly by the Moons influence, and partly by a created aptitude or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculty in them; we ſee often they are, when ſtopt, eaſilier pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at full Moon, than in its declination; the Moon rules princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in Moiſture, and principally in the Moiſture of Feminines, for ſhe is a Feminine Planet; yet in Men the Haemorrhoids are periodical ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times and monthly, and ſome have (but rarely) a <hi>Fluxus Sanguinis per Penem</hi> monthly.</p>
                  <p>Farmers did obſerve in theſe late years of Infection amongſt Horſes, that their Horſes ſickened or died familiarly at New or Full Moon: is not the Diſeaſe <hi>Lunatick</hi> ſo called from the Moon, for that at full Moon they are afflicted monthly? and Phyſicians have obſerved Catarrhs and Defluxions to riſe or fall from the Moon, and to be governed much thereby. <hi>Guainerius</hi> did obſerve one ſpake a ſtrange Tongue he never learned, in New Moons; and other melancholy perſons have at ſuch changes of the Moon alone ſpake a ſtrange Language they never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: If any think we ſpeak ſlightly or conjecturally of many of theſe things, let them ſearch in their proper Chapters Examples in our <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,</hi> and they ſhall ſee them confirmed. It is written of the <hi>Clupaea</hi> Fiſh in <hi>Sagona,</hi> a River of <hi>France,</hi> that in the encreaſe of the Moon it is white, and in its decreaſe black: So the <hi>Piſcis Lunaris,</hi> or <hi>Luna</hi>-fiſh, is ſo appellated from the ſtrange alteration the changes of the Moon makes in her, and her figure: We might be numerous in Examples.</p>

                  <p>It would be too tedious to write of many new Diſeaſes, Epidemical, and ſome of them Contagious, that do happen in all Ages and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs, ſometimes in one place, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another; they certainly come from the Air, and the Air is qualified by the Stars, and Seeds and Attoms ſwim and fluctuate in the Air, as Wood and heavier matter doth in the Water, that is a more ſollid, and leſſe penetrable body than Air.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould too much ſtay the Reader here to give an accompt only of the experience we have had of the Progreſs, Changes and Criſes of Diſeaſes according to the alteration and motion of the Planets, but who ſo is well skilled in Aſtrology and Phyſick, and ſhall at the decum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biture, or chief time of the ſickening of his Patient, draw a Scheam of the Heavens, and obſerve all along the mutations of the Planets, and his ſick Patients diſtemper, he ſhall in moſt Diſeaſes find great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and ſay, It is far more certain Prognoſticating by the Heavens, then ſymptoms in Diſeaſes: Yet in confuſed Diſtempers, and ſuch as we cannot well refer to any name in <hi>Riverius</hi> his Practice, Aſtrology is moſt illuminative.</p>
                  <p>There are divers obſervations extant of the operation of the Planets on mens Bodies, but few, in regard of the uſe there would be of them, and excellency thereof; but theſe would require much time and pains to deſcribe to purpoſe, therefore we ſhall omit them.</p>
                  <p>We ſee alſo there is a ſtrange Antipathetick quality in Lightning to bereave us ſuddenly of Life, and a blaſt of Air blaſts many; ſome in the field, ſome ſtanding at their door; ſome are bereaved of ſence, ſome of motion; ſome in the whole body, ſome only in one particular part; ſome in one manner, ſome in another; ſome in one degree, ſome in another.</p>
                  <p>We will ſpeak a little here in the Vindication of Aſtrology, it may ſatisfie ſome, it need hurt none; Truth alone muſt pleaſe God, and <hi>fraus pia</hi> be condemned.</p>

God doth all by natural cauſes, and what ſhall we ſay are the cauſes of ſuch and ſuch things, but what we experience? if one thing here doth ſympathize and antipathize with another, and one depends upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one governs another; Why may not the Stars more pure, high and great bodies influence upon, and alter theſe leſſer, groſſer and low compoſitions, every Agent being more noble than the Patient? and the Air is the mediate cauſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There may as well be quallifications of peculiarity in the Sun, Moon, and five other Planets in the <hi>Macrocoſm,</hi> as in the Heart and Brain in the <hi>Microcoſm,</hi> and Liver, Spleen, Gall, Lungs and Reins; and if God hath planted Originally in all ſuch bowels peculiar quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and theſe operate accordingly upon the reſt of mans body, inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in dignity to them; why may not the bodies of the Stars have alſo peculiar natures and qualities implanted Originally into them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe they operate? for it is certain all things were made for an uſe, and why they ſhould obſerve ſuch ſtrange motions and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, no other reaſon can be given, than what man hath found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and that for which every thing is moſt fit, for that it was made, and that is the right uſe of it: It would be tedious to relate the wonderful qualities, and Spirits of ſtrange and ſtupendious Natures, that are placed in many bodies, ſlight and ſorry to look on, as the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive force in the Loadſtone; in Herb Moonwort, the chaſtity of Emeralds and Sobriety, the ſhivering of Quickſilver in fire or hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and its flying to Gold; the fighting of Spirit of Tartar and Vitriol, the quality of moving Love in ſome Plants, of diſſolving ſtrife in others; of releaſing the bewitched, and driving away Spirits; of cauſing mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and inducing ſleeping to death: See theſe in one place or other of our <hi>Phyſiology</hi> and <hi>Jatroſophy,</hi> with many more ſtrange and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous qualifications of the Spirits of Plants and Minerals. We do not deny but things affect one another by the Attoms and Exhalations that ariſe from their bodies; but what accompt can any give, why the Attoms of one is of ſuch a quality to cauſe Sobriety, and the Attoms breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from another to cauſe Love, and the Attoms breathing from another to cauſe madneſſe? every body, as it is a body and earth is not active, or moveable; doth neither taſte, nor ſmall, nor hath a colour for the moſt part, but the Spirit that is in it, moves and acts it, makes it grow, taſte and ſmell; and as ſoon as this Spirit or Soul is eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated from it, it looks oftentimes pale, but conſtantly loſeth its ſcent and taſte; ſo when our Souls are gone, we look pale, and corrupt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, even as Plants as ſoon as their Spirit or Soul is gone: bodies were only made for Receptacles of Spirits or Souls, and theſe Souls or
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93369:10"/> Spirits do act and move theſe bodies; and according to the peculiar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or quality of theſe Original implanted Spirits, ſo they act diverſly; now why may not the peculiar qualitied Spirits of the Stars operate and alter the Spirits placed in the bodies of terrene and groſs things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are fit and changeable, eſpecially ſeeing every minute we muſt draw in Air? and if the laying of Plants about us, and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Animals, do ſo alter the Air, that ſometimes we are ſick, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times comforted by them; the Stars may as well do it: What influence hath the Sun for heat upon this world, more then a thouſand Cities ſet on fire? and yet the Sun is at a vaſt diſtance ſo to heat the Air all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. The exactly demonſtrating theſe things, would require a larger diſcourſe than we are willing here to ſpend thereupon. What is our Brain? what doth it look like? a Gelly, or knotty Flegm; yet in this matter is a choice quality implanted, our ſenſation and motion; what is the Heart to look upon, or to feel, or touch, or taſte, or ſmell? meerly fleſh: and yet ſee how it differs in dignity of quality; and there are nobler Spirits placed in it, than in other parts of the body; it hath the Seed of Blood, and is able to change all nouriſhment into red hot Spirituous Blood, ſpecially as Nature ſhall have need thereof; and hereby doth it influence upon all the body, as the Brain by motion and ſenſation operates and alters all the body; GOD could as well have placed the Seminary Principle of Blood, or Sanguification in the Spleen, and the Soul in the Liver, for the fleſh doth nothing; he could have made any fleſh capable of the higheſt qualities and faculties.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Allowing this force to the Planets, and ſome fixed Stars as they happen to be joyned with them, vindicates GOD from injuſtice; for certain it is, that the humors alter our minds, and our conſtitutions change our judgements, and lead us to divers appetites: and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans are not alike fitted in all to be wiſe or fooliſh, ingenuous or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alike.</p>
                  <p>If he that is born a natural Fool, ſhall repine and ſay, <hi>Why was I not born capable of knowledge as other men? what had I done in the Womb to make my Creator more partial to me, than the reſt of man-kind?</hi> It may be Anſwered, It was his lot to be begotten, conceived and born at ſuch an unfortunate time, when the Planets operating upon the propitious matter in <hi>utero</hi> ſo diſpoſed him.</p>
                  <p>Another may Object, <hi>Why was I made of ſuch a melancholy temper, to be dejected at every ſmall buſineſs, and to ſwoon at every light grief, and to be diſcontented with my life?</hi> Some muſt be melancholy, as ſome are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; there muſt be variety; and it fell according to their nativity to be ſuch, without any partiality, or ill reſpects in GOD towards them: ſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93369:10"/> for the paſſionate, that ſuffer for their Tongues, and cannot help it, they wiſh they were of another temper, and could forbear; and are apt to be angry that they are ſo apt to be angry: but ſome muſt be angry, elſe there would be none patient if all were alike; and it fell caſually to their lot to be ſo: if God did immediately, without contingent cauſes, ordain or make them ſo, they might have ſomewhat more to ſay and to repine at; but now God is blameleſs, for where the cauſe accidentally falls, the effects follow: but the cauſes are ſo wiſely from all eternity ordered, that they ſhall keep in a mean, and not much tranſgreſs; as thoſe cauſes that diſpoſe men to be natural fools, or Atheiſts, ſhall not come ſo often by one to a hundred, as thoſe cauſes that cauſe Wiſdom and Worſhip; nor ſhall they come altogether, but ſhall happen now and then, that Nature may have ſome variety.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps a good mans Barn is burnt by Lightning, and his Neighbours, a wicked mans, is unhurt; God is no reſpecter of Perſons nor partial, it fell out according to natural cauſes, that the Lightning did direct to this mans Barn in a contingent manner; and it is the nature of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, where the Beams and Attoms are conglomerated, and ſo made ſtronger, to burn; if God had with material hands took a Torch and ſet it on fire, as <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> ſeem to think him to act, ſurely then the juſt man had had ſomewhat to have ſaid: it is a dignity to God to act by cauſes, and one cauſe under another; the outward cauſe operates up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inward cauſe, and the remote upon the vicine, the primary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the inſtrumentary: If a King would have any thing done, and muſt do it himſelf, it would not be ſuch honour to him, as to do it by ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient means, and meſſengers; ſo God is the more dignified and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by Nature, then if, as <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> would have him, he did all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by material Hands, Feet and Mouth, without the intervene of natural cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it Rains twice as much in one Land or Soil as needs, and in another Land or Soil at the ſame time is not half Rain enough, ſo that both are ſpoiled, one by a flood, the other by drought; and if God did this immediately by immediate counſel, and with material hands, as if he ſhould pour down buckets, without the contingency of natural cauſes, how might men complain, and ſay, <hi>God dealt hardly with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many times upon the Sea a Winde ariſes and drowns a good mans Ship, wherein are far better perſons than in another Ship, that at that time arrives ſafe.</p>
                  <p>Many times a good man is wounded of Thieves going abroad, is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a fall, or taken with the Plague, or killed with Lightning, when many far worſe at the ſame time, and in that place may eſcape; and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93369:11"/> were it not that all things here happen alike to all in a contingent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to us, though predeſtinated and pre-ordained by GOD, we might repine; the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhines on the good and bad, and rain falls on the juſt and unjuſt: And Man is ordained as Aſtronomers will ſhew by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating a Mans Nativity, to this or that good or miſchief that he will hardly avoid; and becauſe we do not fore-know or fore-ſee, we muſt act warily and wiſely; for we do not know, though it is predeſtinated to us to be poor or miſerable, or evil, but by our endeavour we may avoid it; for we do not know our Endeavours will be bootleſs, till we ſee the event; ſo we act as if nothing was predeſtinated: All our labours and endeavours, if it be not ordained, ſhall not make as rich, or eminent, or favoured, or lucky.</p>
                  <p>Yet GOD commonly ordains a Thing by ordaining the Cauſe; as ſuch a man is ordained to thrive; why? becauſe he is made of a cunning induſtrious and parſimonious temper; yet many a great Drinker, ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unskilful fellow, in compariſon of ſuch, ſhall thrive and grow richer: Nature is full of variety, and degrees and kindes in every kinde.</p>
                  <p>Did not things alſo in States and Kingdoms fall out according to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous and accidental hap, and the fortune of Mens happy Nativities, why did <hi>Mahomet</hi> that Great Impoſtor, ariſe to that credit and honour in the World?

                  <p>4. Next will follow to be ſpoken of the Signs of Diſeaſes: and in theſe is an high miſunderſtanding, both in thoſe that write, and thoſe that read Practices of Phyſick, chiefly the laſt: for if the Ancients, and moſt of the Moderns or Neotericks were out in the Cauſes, they muſt needs be in the Signs that they appropriated to ſuch Cauſes: if there be any diſpute about this, let my Antagoniſts obſerve the twenty next Patients that come under their hands, (for in ſo many the Rules of Nature may be diſcovered) and ſee if their Diſeaſes and Signs will hold and run parallel with thoſe of the Diſeaſes they read in <hi>Barrow, Ronde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letius, Etius, Aegineta, Primroſius, Riverius,</hi> &amp;c. Truly ſo far as I have obſerved many Patients, (having writ about 1400 Obſervations for my own private uſe hitherto) and read Obſervations of many other men, I cannot finde Nature is confined to a method, or runs in that road Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have delivered; and who ſo opens many, ſhall finde that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Spleen, Reins, Gall, Stomach, Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are otherwiſe affected than as the Ancients thought; and that they do onely caſually and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally light to be ſo affected as the Ancients have deciphered; the affection of the Bowels in the diffected, agrees chiefly in diſagreeing: The Truth is, where we have one Patient that by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concurrence of Signs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93369:15"/> ſeems to have any one Diſeaſe named in Practices of Phyſick, we have three that are referrable to none of thoſe Diſeaſes; and in many Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſometimes together, we finde ſuch rare Caſes that never before we ſaw or read of. Alſo the Change in Diſeaſes is very conſiderable; to day, or in this hour, the Sick moſt complains of Headach; to morrow, or the next hour, the Headach is gone, or with it remaining is a Stomach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain; the next day it is changed into vomiting and purging, and then perhaps that ſtops, and the Party is Heart-burned: and a multitude of ſuch various Changes are ſometime in ſome ſick People, that lie long; and what ſhall we call this Diſeaſe? ſometimes many Bowels are weak or diſeaſed together, and by the Signs, where ſhall the Diſeaſe be?</p>
                  <p>For Example ſake, we will ſhew by one how the Courſe and Order of Nature may be gueſſed at in many.</p>
                  <p>Here died lately a Gentlewoman of <hi>Hitchin,</hi> ſhe lay ſix weeks ſick; had a fall out of a Coach, being with child; ſhe was very well, her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of child-bearing conſidered, for a fortnight after, ſhe was a little bruiſed betwixt the ſhoulders, all ſeems to be well; a fortnight after the fall ſhe grows ill, as formerly in child-bearing ſhe had been, of windy pains and ſtitches; it took her with a little Cough and raiſing, and the pain did remit, and go into her Shoulder and Back, her Urine high, and Pulſe pretty ſwift, ſome ſigns of a windy, ſome of a legitimate Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: after a week ſhe grew better for a day or two, then worſe; her ſpitting and excretion encreaſed, and pain fixed in her right ſide; ſhe could hardly ſwallow, that ſhewed the Oeſophagus hurt, and upwards on high, any hard thing hurt her; ſhe took Lohocks, and raiſed much or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Flegm, like an Empyema: then a week after her raiſing conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing now and then, ſhe ſpat Blood, her Coughing frequent, and one morning ſhe vomited much Blood by Coughing and Excretion; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the new ſymptom Haemoptoe ceaſed, ſhe was <hi>partitis vicibus</hi> let Blood: after a month or three weeks ſhe grew finely well, her ſtomach to meat was recruited, her ſleep greater, her coughing not ſo much, and the purulency leſs; then a week being paſſed, ſhe grew worſe, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained no more of the Oeſophagus, her Expuition and Cough urge, and her Legs ſwell, and ſhe grows Aſthmatical, ſhe raifeth much faetid Flegm, but now void of Blood; ſometimes a fit of raiſing eaſes her ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain, which the laſt weeks did not much trouble her, and ſometimes not; and ſometimes her Aſthma fits were eaſed by coughing, and ſometimes not; her Aſthma ſometimes left her, and then ſhe was hugely provoked to cough and raiſe; ſhe wanted ſleep and an appetite to any food; her Aſthmatical fits being but three or four, though ſhe was always at laſt ſhortwinded, left her before her death, and ſhe raiſed, as if matter did
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93369:16"/> flow into the Lungs from ſome vicine part exceeding; and two hours afore death ſhe felt her ſelf oppreſſed with this matter, and raiſed nigh half a pint, coughing and ſpitting it forth; and after this great fit of raiſing, fainted, and her Head ſhook, and ſhe died with ratling of the matter in her Cheſt: ſhe deſired to riſe before ſhe died, and talked chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and much, the night before ſhe died; and theſe in many are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of death, but not in the generality. Here were divers other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and changes of leſs note, that came on, and went off again: ſhe was delivered very eaſily, and during two or three dayes of purging, after her delivery, her Coughing was eaſie, ſhe raiſed leſs, and her pain and Aſthma very little, but her Lochyes ſtopping, the Aſthma and Purulent Matter encreaſed, and ſhe died three or four dayes after. Moſt Phyſicians thought her delivery would have freed her; the Childe was very lively in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tero,</hi> notwithſtanding her ſickneſs, and born well, but died a week after, having principles of Corruption in it from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; one thought it a true Pleuriſie, another a baſtard one at firſt; then it ſeemed an inflamation of the mouth of the Stomack; then ſome Signs ſhewed it in the Stomack; for in Child-bearing ſhe uſed to vomit, and this was reſtrained after ſhe ſickened: ſome ſigns were for Adhaeſion of the Lungs, ſome for an Empyema; ſome that the Lungs did ſwim in purulency, ſome of ſtopped Blood; ſome Signs argued it inwardly, as hurt in ſwallowing, ſome outwardly as her ſoreneſs in her ſide to touch; ſome argued VVind, for when it went into her ſhoulder and back, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in the ſide.</p>
                  <p>A month after ſhe ſickened (but ſhe was let blood before) her blood looked like yellow fat Broath when it was cold, and in it were ſeveral congealed fleeces, like bits of corrupted fleſh.</p>
                  <p>VVho would think in thoſe that have piſſed purulent matter, that it came from the Heart, as appeared by diſſection; <hi>in vivo omnia ſunt pervia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Let us conſider the Prognoſticks; He is a wiſe Phyſician that is not raſh herein: I know a Phyſician of mean parts, and great practice, that I have admired he ſhould happen to judge Life or Death ſo falſly, inſomuch that other Phyſicians have made it a rule to go by, that ſuch a party will live, becauſe ſuch a Phyſician ſaith, She will die, and ſo on the contrary: what can be found in the Pulſe and Urines?</p>
                  <p>They talk of a Serratile or Saw-Pulſe, Vermiculating or Crawling Pulſe, and Intermitting Pulſe. I could never find any thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in worth taking notice of; in well people the Pulſe will intermit as well as in ſick, and in dying people it is ſeldom found; and it is oft the fancy of the Phyſician that muſt make all things, ſo as he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93369:16"/> reads: the chief difference in Pulſes is, <hi>the ſwiftneſs, and ſlowneſſe, ſtrength and faintneſs of the beating;</hi> and what may be judged hereby, is this; in ſickneſs, (for in health with working or running, the Pulſe will beat faſter, and in ſome perſons naturally ſtronglier than in others, and than at other times) The ſwiftneſs of the Pulſe argues an Enemy in the Blood, or an Humour of an Heterogenious quality to it, that the Heart, as the Blood paſſeth through it, taſts and feels; and therefore lets it out as ſoon as ever it is in, and being out by <hi>Fuga Vacui,</hi> dilating it ſelf, draws in more, and ſo ſends it ſwiftly about the whole Body; if there be an high Heterogeneity the Heart expels it the Blood by the Pores and Habit of the body, or ſome particular part, if the Heart is ſtrongeſt, and there be Principles of Fermentation in the humor ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified: now if with this ſwiftneſs there is ſtrength of the Pulſe, it argues Nature is ſtrong, and the Spirits are not extinct; if with this ſwiftneſs the Pulſe is faint and weak, the Spirits are ſunk, and there is feebleneſs and fainting; for in Syncope and Deliquiums ſcarce any Pulſe is found, or very little and ſmall.</p>
                  <p>Urines are looked upon by the Vulgar, as the greateſt Prophetical matter about the Body of Man; how familiar is it, and as ridiculous and abſurd as familiar, to carry waters to Phyſicians, to know parties diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, not telling a word of their Symptoms to the Phyſician; judging him filly and unlearned in all other things, that cannot tell all their Ails by their Water? and this they do frequently, not intending to take Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, but to beſtow a Groat to know what their Diſeaſe is, (which they underſtand as much as Geeſe) and how and when they may recover, and whether they ſhall live or die by their Water; the which, if a Phyſician knows all the Symptoms about the ſick, and his Conſtitution, and could ſee into his Body, he could not oftentimes truly determine of: in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people frequently the Water grows better, and in well people it will change ſtrangely, be ſometimes paler, ſometimes redder; ſometimes thicker, ſometimes thinner: the Nights Water is oft unlike to the Dayes; and ſome well perſons make thick crude Water, and in others, when it is cold, it is thick and ſedementary like the ſick; the very food we eat, and liquor we drink, alter our Urine. I have read of a Fruit in the new World, a kind to <hi>Coecus Baphicus,</hi> that when our Countrey-men ate of it, it ſo coloured their Urine, that they thought they had piſſed blood, and were afraid to eat any more: ſo I have heard of other things, ſome that uſe to drink much Wine, piſs the ſame for ſmell and colour.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, when the Urine paſſeth only by and through a few parts, I ſee not how it ſhould ſhew the Conſtitution of all parts; it doth ſhew chiefly diſtempers of the <hi>Kidneys</hi> and <hi>Bladder,</hi> but that being the Sink
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93369:17"/> and Channel, Nature ſtrives to waſh off, and throw much filth that way by the <hi>Kidneys</hi> and <hi>Bladder,</hi> and Urine, as Water is good to waſh off and make Faeculency and Sordity ſwim away; that is ſome reaſon therefore, that both in Cronical and Critical diſtempers, thick muddy ſedementary Urine is good, when the Diſeaſe is breaking away, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if before the Urine was clear and limpid, and as if it was ſtrained from all foul matter.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I have often, to ſatisfie people, gueſſed at their Diſtempers by their Urines, and one may often pleaſe them; if it was an high red Water, I judged a Feaveriſh temper, and then I gueſſed that they had Head-ach, Back-pains, Thirſt, want of Appetite, Heat, want of Reſt, Faintneſs, one day worſe than another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with variation; if the Urine was pale and thin, I gueſſed at Obſtructions, that it was ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in Obſtructions uſually are theſe ſymptoms, Windineſs, pain at Stomach, and ſtoppage, and loading there with inappetence and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dupepſia,</hi> or ill digeſtion; ſhort-windedneſs, Aches in Knees and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and by fits in the Head, paleneſs of Countenance, dulneſs to Action and Wearineſs, heavineſs of the Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in Men and Women is great variation; indeed we ſhall rarely find two exactly alike in all things; but theſe things thus conjectured, have often pleaſed; <hi>Populus qui vult decipi decipiatur,</hi> That people that will be deceived, let them be deceived. Some will undertake to tell them, whether it is a Mans or Womans Water, their Diſeaſe, and whether they will die or live.</p>
                  <p>Indeed in Hair-piſſing, VVorm-piſſing, (which <hi>Rondeletius</hi> ſaith, <hi>He would not believe, till he had once ſeen them)</hi> Stones, Gravel, Blood, yellow Urine, <hi>mucus</hi> or <hi>pus</hi> and ſuch like; ſomewhat is ſhewen of the very thing that cauſeth the diſeaſe, but how it is ſeated in the Body, in what degree, and in what part, we are often to ſeek notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> of <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> were pretty good, ſo much as he wrote thereof, and founded upon what he had experienced; yet becauſe we meet with ſuch variety, we muſt not expect them to hold good (as to the plurality of them) in each other perſon that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; tis well if in one in three they hold good; and ſome of them will rarely be found true, becauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> writ them from the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome one ſingular caſe we ſhall ſeldom ſee again, or eſpecially to terminate ſo.</p>
                  <p>We will here write a few <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> Signs, that the Reader in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other books may not be deceived in his underſtanding, or expect more then he ſhall find.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. Every Diſeaſe how dangerous and truculent ſoever, is not in all and at all times Mortal; nor is any Diſeaſe ſo ſlight and trivial, but at ſometimes in ſome it may lead to death.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Rarely in any one ſick perſon ſhall we find all Signs Mortal, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept nigh death; nor rarely in any conſiderable ſickneſs ſhall we finde all ſigns of health; but we judge from the major number, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ones.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. That Diſeaſe that is ſlight and ſmall at firſt, may be mortal at laſt, for that that in a remiſs degree cauſeth ſickneſs, in an extream may cauſe death, <hi>a minimis maxima,</hi> from the leaſt beginnings are often great events; but we are in all caſes to be ſparing in Praediction for Life or Death, for that is only in the fore-knowledge of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Some ſicken one day and die the next; ſome have many Criſes, and do hold out divers years; and ſome after a tedious ſickneſs die, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers live; if we would praedict herein, the chief thing is, to tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of the principal Bowels are waſted, changed or corrupted, in all this while.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. All intermitting diſtempers <hi>(quoad intermiſſionem)</hi> are ſafer than confirmed and continued, becauſe theſe ſhew Wind or Water, or ſome Fluxible matter, and that the parenchyma of no part, or maſs of blood is much affected; and alſo in the Intervals, Nature gets ſtrength and relief, and the greater they be, the more. Furthermore it ſhews, that there are ſome Seeds in the Blood and Humors, that grow to maturity in ſuch a time, and traſmute ſo much matter; and then the ſpirits of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother nature to it, fight with it, raiſe a fermentation, and throw it off; and then Nature is quiet, till the remaining Seeds grow to maturity, and have infected as much more matter.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Nature doth not obſerve that order or method of proceeding in Criſes, as hath moſt generally been thought: but to ſome a Criſis is the 1ſt, to ſome the ſecond, to others the third, fourth, fifth or ſixth day; and then, three, or four, or five, or ſix dayes after: nor do moſt that die, die in a fit, but for the moſt part after divers fits, which do not come at ſet times, nor are juſt of an equality, and of one manner; the ſick die in calmneſs and ſetledneſs of mind, and as the Vulgar obſerve, do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lighten before death: And that is a bad ſign, when the ſick ſhall ſay, <hi>They are well, and feel no pain or ail,</hi> ſuddenly, and on no apparent cauſe, that were very ſick &amp; weak a little before. Indeed we ſee Feavers obſerve Criſes or Paroxiſmes, and therefore call them intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p n="7">VII. In all Diſeaſes obſerve what was wonted to the Sick in health, thoſe things are not ſo bad in ſickneſs: every Diſeaſe ſo far as it differs from Nature, the worſe; any thing that wont not to be in health is bad, or if it be in either extreme.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. If thoſe things that ſhould refreſh, as ſleep, eaſe, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make the worſe after them, 'tis bad; and joyned with other ill Symptoms may give ſuſpicion of death.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. There is no Diſeaſe but one time or another, in one or other, is cureable; and there is no Diſeaſe ſo ſlight and momentleſs, but in ſome or other, at one time or other, it is incureable: yet though from Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of Phyſick we reckon of onely ſo many and juſt ſuch Diſeaſes, yet there are many grand Alterations, Tranſmutations, Corruptions, Enfiſſures, Animification, Petrification, Apoſtemation, Adhaeſion and Abſumption of Parts and Bowels, that are commonlieſt in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and loweſt degree incureable:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are hard to be known by ſigns, and then fit Medicines are not preſcribed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Medicines taken, come not nigh thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Medicines are not long enough, or largely enough taken, though very proper.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. All Diſeaſes of Malignity, wherein there is a ſeparation of the infected matter in the Blood, from the Blood, if that recoils and ſinks into the Blood again, it ſheweth death, and rarely otherwiſe, if the matter have an high Heterogeneity to the quality of our Spirits conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting our Vitality; therefore few that have the Plague-Sores or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles that go in and fall flat, or in the Pox, but they die; but in Flea-Spots, Red Gum, Spots of Children, Ring-Worms, Tetters, Impeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the matter is not ſo contrary to our <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Humours;</hi> if it fall back, or ſink into the <hi>Blood,</hi> it kills not commonly: Yet Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have gone on hugely blinded in theſe things; for whatſoever
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93369:18"/> matter by Feaver and Fermentation is caſt forth of the <hi>Blood</hi> by the Skin and <hi>Habitum Corpois,</hi> if it lie outwardly a few days, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſweat and be hot, the Spirits of that Humour that contain the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inimical to our nature, fly forth and exhale; and then if the inſipid and mild <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Humour</hi> be ſoaked up again, it doth no harm; for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture finding it purged of thoſe high Antipathetick Spirits, receives it as a ſimilar matter: Every thing, yea, Inanimate things, apply to, and draw to them things not agreeing in figure but quality, and things of contrary qualified Spirits put off and withdraw from one another: and leſt any ſhould think this opinional onely, (as moſt received Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are) we have related many ſound Experiments and Obſervations in our Book called <hi>Phyſiology, Jatroſophy</hi> and <hi>Pneumatography,</hi> which none denying, all muſt confeſs,</p>
                     <q>Silentia non negat.</q>
                     <p n="11">XI. In every Diſeaſe, Acute or Cronical, if a Dyſpnaea or Aſthma ſupervene, it is an Evil Sign; becauſe we live by breathing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Heart, the Fountain of Life, wants fanning and blowing up, to keep the natural fire of our <hi>Bodies</hi> from dying or going out.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. In all ſickneſſes, though there be no pains, no apparant ill ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, and though all the Bowels ſeem firm, and the Party is pretty ſtrong, yet if the Heart, the Fountain of Life, ſink, and faint, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, without intermiſſions, and the Spirits are depreſſed, be not too ſecure; for the evil qualities of the malevolent Planets, raiſe the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deſtroy our Life in a Confuſed Diſeaſe, without any known Cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. In all Diſeaſes wherein Deliriums, Fluxes of Blood, Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Looſneſs, <hi>Singultus,</hi> or great Appetite, do ſupervene, ſometimes Death, ſometimes Recovery ſuddenly terminates and ends that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; yet there is probability why Fluxes in ſome may cure, and lead to Death in others: for the ſame Signs and Accidents are not likely to ſignifie ſo bad in ſome Caſes and Conſtitutions, as in others.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. If any one is inwardly afflicted, and ſeemingly in Noble Parts, and afterward he is outwardly afflicted, and in the Extremities or Superficies, uſually it is looked upon as a good ſign, and ſo indeed it is, unleſs it be an Expatiation of the Morbifick Matter, and not a Tranſlation; for if withal the Inward and Nobler Parts are as much afflicted as before, when the Superficies and Extremities of the Body were not ſwoln, it is an Argument of Death, and weakneſs of Nature to repel.</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93369:19"/>XV. In prognoſticating concerning any outward Humour, Abſceſs, or Flegm, we muſt conſider whether is moſt in fault, the part affected, that being naturally or caſually weakened, cannot repel; or being ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated, doth violently draw; or the foulneſs and fulneſs of the Body, that ſends Matter and Humours to a part weaker than others: if the fault lies principally in a remote part that cannot repel, or elſe attracts, commonly it is not ſo bad as when the Blood is loaded with faeculent Humours, and doth there on heaps diſgorge them, and makes it its Channel, thither to ſend its off-purgings; yet when both are together, the worſe: therefore ſwelling of the Legs after Agues are often of troubleſome conſequence.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. In all Diſeaſes the more the Spittle, Urine, Excrements and Sweat break forth in quantity or manner, contrary to Nature, and what thoſe people uſed to have in health, ſo much the worſe; and the more Winde, Flegm, and Water we ſee in the ſick, the worſe, becauſe they ſhew defect in the Concoction, Heat, and free paſſage in the Bowels and Body.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. In all Diſeaſes, where there are ſigns of no <hi>Bowel</hi> to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or waſted, or corrupted, and that the maſs of <hi>Blood</hi> is not affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is great hope of cure, and that by vomiting, purging and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for Diſeaſes that come from corruption of the Food, putrefaction of Humours, and Obſtructions in the firſt ways, lie liable to have their Cauſe eaſily removed, and then the Effects ceaſe: <hi>Tolle Cauſam, &amp; ceſſat Effectus.</hi> It is a great piece of Art to diſtinguiſh <hi>inter ſimilia;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt unlikes every ſtupid man may diſcern: Windineſs, gripings, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting pains, vomiting, looſneſs, unſavory belchings, breaking winde downwards, purſineſs, clogging and ſhort windedneſs, the colour, ſmell, and conſiſtence of things caſt out, and what is retained, ſhew Diſeaſes in the firſt Ways, or Stomach, ſmall Guts and great Ones, or Urinary paſſage.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. Where in a ſick Perſon we finde many Symptoms, ſome ſeeming to ſhew a Diſeaſe in one Part, ſome in another, ſome Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of long laſting, others of a ſudden termination of the Diſeaſe; we muſt judge from the moſt and ſtrongeſt, what and where the Diſeaſe is, and how and when it will ceaſe; alſo thoſe Symptoms that laſt longeſt, and without intermiſſion, and that came firſt, are moſt ſignificant.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. Moſt Diſeaſes that come from an outward, procatarctick and known Cauſe, commonly are moſt void of Danger, and ſometimes by forbearing what they knew gave occaſion to the riſe of the Diſeaſe, are cured by Nature: In others, the knowing of what cauſed a Diſeaſe,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93369:19"/> gives good grounds for the appropriation of Medicines to cure it: As the Vulgar uſe to ſay, <hi>A Diſeaſe well known, is half cured.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="20">XX. We are to conſider the nature of the Bowels: for a Humour in ſuch a part familiar thereto, is not ſo dangerous as in another part; witneſs Flegm in the Lungs, Winde in the Inteſtines: Stones, Iron, Bones, hard Things, Bullets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Stomach, being things ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and accuſtomed to the Stomach, are not ſo dangerous as in other Parts not accuſtomed thereto, and not having a capacity for, and ways to avoid, and the faculty to digeſt them; in the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Nobler Parts and Seats of the Heat, Spirits, Motion and Senſation in us, thoſe Humours that both for quantity and quality may not hurt in other parts, may in theſe kill; and in all Diſeaſes of the <hi>Bowels, Blood,</hi> or <hi>Humours,</hi> we are chiefly to conſider whether the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or quality moſt offend; for accordingly we muſt preſage and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize our Cure.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things are good for a Phyſician to know, and do hold true for the moſt part: but it is very frequent that we finde thoſe that ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will not dye, to dye; and divers that ſeem by all Symptoms likely to dye, recover; yea, and ſome that are thought departing, and have their paſſing <hi>Bell</hi> rung, recover: thence is the Vulgar Proverb, <hi>So long as life, there is hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We will here give the Reader one Example, whereby he may judge of others, and of the Cauſe and Current of many Diſeaſes, after this manner; but the Stars ſhew more in Acute than Cronical Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
                     <p>A Kinſman of mine, one Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> a Miniſter of a Neighbour Town called <hi>Barton,</hi> falling ſick about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1662, died <hi>Auguſt</hi> 15. in the morning, I drew a Scheam of his ſickneſs, but had not the time of his Decumbiture, but found his ſickneſs corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond exactly with the Scheam, according to the common Rules of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology: <hi>Cancer</hi> was upon the Cuſp of the ſixth Houſe, the Houſe of Sickneſs, a Sign that governs the <hi>Breſt,</hi> and is Watery; and he was chiefly afflicted in his <hi>Breſt,</hi> and much troubled with moiſture and winde, and vomited: the Moon Lady of the Sixth being weak, and afflicted by <hi>Mars,</hi> made him troubled with Choler; <hi>Mercury</hi> was his Significator, Lord of the Third, being a Kiſman, he was Retrogade in the ſixth Houſe, and nigh Combuſtion, going to it in his Retrograde Motion; that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued him very weak, faint, and oppreſſed with heat, and ſo he was, yet not clearly a Feaver, as divers have; his Urine moderately high, he was given to fighting; when <hi>Mercury</hi> came to <hi>Cazimi</hi> with the <hi>Sun,</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:93369:20"/> he died not, but when the Moon, Lady of the Houſe of Sickneſs, came to a perfect Quartile Aſpect with <hi>Mars,</hi> Lord of the Houſe of Death, then died that <hi>Good Man:</hi> The night before he died, the Moon applied to a Sextile with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and Trine with <hi>Mercury,</hi> and then he had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and they were in hopes of his Recovery; but leaving thoſe Aſpects, ſhe drew to an Aſpect of Enmity with <hi>Mars,</hi> Lord of the Eighth, and then he ſuddenly changed. There were ſeveral Signs of his death; <hi>Mercury</hi> his Significator, in the ſixth Houſe, Retrograde, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Combuſtion; <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of the Eighth Houſe, and <hi>Saturn</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the Moon weak; <hi>Cancer</hi> upon the Sixth, being a moveable Sign, and <hi>Mars</hi> afflicting the Moon: There were ſome Tokens of the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice ſometimes, and he vomited Cholerick matter, and wateriſh; and though he took a vomit, it ſtill lay at his Cheſt.</p>
                     <p>6. Let us take notice of the Judicatations and Cure, both for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Medicine, that the Ancients and Neotericks that follow them have ſet down: In Cacochymy, we muſt alter; in Phlethory, purge, and bleed, and ſweat; in Cold, we muſt heat; and in Heat, cool; we muſt moiſten the Dry, and dry the Moiſt: Theſe are approved Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rules, and are certainly true and good, <hi>quoad modum &amp; gradum: Conſideratis conſiderandis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the cure of all Diſeaſes, we ſhall chiefly meet with two differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 1. Diſeaſes of Quality, 2. of Quantity.</p>
                     <p>Diſeaſes of Quality are cured with, 1. Antidotes, 2. Specificals.</p>
                     <p>Diſeaſes of Quantity are cured with Vomiting, Purging, Bleeding, Sweating, and Diureticals; wherein are introduced Driers, Moiſtners, Heaters, Coolers, Openers and Stypticks.</p>
                     <p>Firſt. Concerning the cure of Diſeaſes of Quality, theſe things are moſt conſiderable; That every peculiar quality muſt be oppoſed by a peculiar quality oppoſite to it: in our Bodies, in one or other, at one time or other, are moſt, if not all the qualities that are in the Earth, in Animals, Plants and Minerals; and we finde ſuch a Plant agrees with ſcarce any man, and another agrees with this man, and not that; it is becauſe in the firſt Plant was a qualified Spirit Heterogenious to the common Nature of Mankind; in the ſecond a quality there was He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogenious onely to the peculiar qualification of the Humours in ſome Bodies: thoſe that are uſed to take Poyſons, take them harmleſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their <hi>Blood</hi> is by the frequent uſe of thoſe things changed into their nature, and ſo not being contraries do not fight: One thing is an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote for the Plague, becauſe in it the Spirits are of an heterogenious and adverſe quality to the quality that ferments our <hi>Blood;</hi> another thing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93369:20"/> is an Antidote for the Pox, and kills the the venom or quality thereof, that is not ſo peculiarly oppoſite to the Peſtilence; another killeth the quality of the <hi>Blood</hi> and Juyces in the French Pox, that hath no adverſe Spirit to the Small Pox: One thing is good in a malignant Pleuriſie, Angina, or Peripneumonia, that doth no good in ordinary Quinzies or Pleuriſies: <hi>Riverius</hi> did well obſerve that bleeding People of a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Diſeaſe, in one City all died; in another, where the Diſeaſe ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame, all lived that were let blood: See <hi>Riverius</hi> his Accompt of Malignant and Peſtilent Diſeaſes, their Cauſes from the Stars, in <hi>Capite de Febre Peſtilenti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the Reaſon in things Inanimate one kills and deads another, one draws one to it, and expels or draws back from another? is it not the adverſe and inimical qualities in them? They that pleaſe to ſearch our <hi>Phyſiology</hi> of Qualities, Sympathies and Antipathies, may finde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Examples and large Experiences thereof: So that it is a weakneſs in thoſe that know not Nature or its variety, to conjecture ſuch Effects come about from the form or figure of things, and correſpodent pores in things that receive the Attoms of ſuch a figure.</p>
                     <p>We read of two <hi>Thebane</hi> Princes, <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> two Brothers, who bore one another a deadly hatred in their Life-time, and fighting a Duel they killed one another; and according to the manner of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> were to be burnt to Aſhes, to keep their Aſhes Monumentally in a Pot, and ſo never bury them in the ground as we do; their Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both laid in one fire together, the flame divided, and went up in two tops, ſo that their dead and ſenceleſs <hi>Bodies</hi> ſeemed diſcontented to lie together, who in life had ſo hated one another.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt many acute, malign, and confuſed ſickneſſes, would be beſt, eaſilieſt and certainlieſt cured by Plants of that Planet that are antipathetical to the Planet that is found to cauſe the <hi>Diſeaſe;</hi> alſo by Sympathy, that way Plants may cure; as, take an Herb of <hi>Venus</hi> to cure a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> cauſed by <hi>Mars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I wiſh Phyſicians would take notice how many ordinary illiterate People cure <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> frequently with one Trifle or ſmall Simple, when they with their Methods and many Compoſitions, Intrinſicks and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſicks, fail to do it: often they give but one Medicine or two, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it, and that a Simple for the moſt part; witneſs the cure of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gripings, Pains and Stitches, which they cure commonly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with Acorns, or Stich-Holly, or Powder of refined Roſin; Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice they cure eaſily and oft with Specificals, as, Lice, Saffron, or Turnerick, Earth-Worms, or Chelidone-Roots: Dropſies they cure without ſuch Methods and ſeveral Intentions without compoſitions, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93369:21"/> multiplication of them, with Horſe-Radiſh-Roots, Eldern or Dane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Flower-de-luce-Roots, or Guaiacum: Agues they cure eaſilier and ſpeedilier with Camphir hung about their Necks, than with all the Methods and Compoſitions Phyſicians uſe commonly: So with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Five-leav'd-Graſs, or decoction of Herbigraſs, Feaverfuge, and Centuary, or any one of them, do the Vulgar, thrice given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their fits, oft drive away Agues; or with Yarrow, Plantain and Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles bruiſed, and laid to their Wriſts, or Garlick and Gunpowder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are Specificals. Almoſt in all <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of quantity, is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nature and qualification of the morbid Humour: What variety is there in the Method of Phyſicians? and how in one Diſtemper let ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight unknown to one another, be ſet to preſcribe, and they will variouſly direct, not onely for Medicines but Method; one will think purging requiſite, another not; he may rather approve of vomiting; this may be againſt it, and hold bleeding moſt requiſite; another is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all evacuation, and holds onely alteration good: another he is for Aſtrological Cure, and ſees what Planet gave the diſtemper, and uſes an Herb of an Enemy Planet to cure by Antipathy, or of an Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Planet to cure by Sympathy; yet we may find ſome Herbs under the dominion of ſuch a Planet, very improper; but a wiſe Phyſician will take thoſe that are proper for the Diſeaſe, <hi>ſua Natura:</hi> One or two Specificals that ſure and tried Experience manifeſt, do more than large Compoſitions hodge-podge, and miſh-maſh, and Chaos's of Simples.</p>
                     <p>I wonder, not onely the common People, but Phyſicians, and in other reſpects wiſe ones, that they ſhould idolize Mithridate, Venice Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and <hi>Mathiolus</hi> his Antidote, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> large Miſcelanies of all together, that were intended to be good for every thing, and ſpecial for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>I ask whether Compoſitions have Virtues that none of the Simples have? If they receive their Virtue from the Simples, then he that knows the nature of the Simples, may beſt judge the force, and nature, and doſe of the Compoſition. I ask whether every Simple doth not retain its virtue and force? if not, why were they put in? if they do, then are there contradictions, to inſiſt onely on Mithridate, by which all others may be judged after that manner. If any give it for the Head, it muſt be becauſe ſome of the Simples, or moſt, are good therefore, and thence the compoſition receives its virtue; Fennel Seed, Oil of Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, and Caſtorium are appropriated thereto, &amp; what are theſe to forty other things improper, in a dram of Mithridate? very few, if any grains of theſe are therein, and were they not the ſtronger given alone in due quantity?
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93369:21"/> Beſide if we intend to help a ſtupid diſtemper of the Brain by Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, becauſe in it are Peppers, Staechas, Caſtorium, Fennel Seeds, <hi>Ol. Nuciſtae, &amp;c.</hi> do we not do more hurt by the Opium that is in Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date? What Diſeaſe may not ſome of the Simples be proper for? and what Diſeaſe is the whole Compound fit for? be not Agarick, Opopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax, Ornis and Aſarabacca-Roots purging? Hypochyſtis, Acatia, red Roſe Leaves, Frankinſence and Storax binding? Turpentine, Caſſia Lignea, Scordium, Fennel Seeds, Acorus, Saint Johns Wort, Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, are ſomewhat opening; and Cinamon, Spicknard, and Celtica, Gum Arabick, red Roſe Leaves, Opium, Acatia, Hypociſtis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtop up and bind, hinder all Fluxes, and ſtop and indurate the Humours; ſome are violently hot, as the ſorts of Peppers, Acorus, Myrth, Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, Ginger, and Muſtard Seed, Caſtorium, Cardamoms, Cubebs, Opopanax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Opium withſtands them all; ſo that if they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a cold Diſeaſe, becauſe moſt are hot, Opium adds to the Diſeaſe; if an hot Diſeaſe, becauſe Opium ſtops motion the producer of heat, the other will inflame; ſo that it can be given no way to do good, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way it may do harm: ſome things are proper in any Diſeaſe, and ſome improper in any Diſeaſe: in Contraries muſt needs be contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: beſides, ſome are proper for one part, ſome for another, ſo that the Compoſition is peculiar to none: Some are Arthritical, as Coſtus, Fennel Seeds, Caſtor, Ginger, Staechas, Acorus; ſome Pectoral, as Styrax, Gum Arabick, Saffron, Myrrh, and red Roſe Leaves; ſome Hyſterical, as Galbanum, Opopanax, Sagapen, Opium and Caſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; ſome are Hepatical, as Gentian, Aſarabacca, Orris and Caſſia Lignea; ſome are breaking Wind, or Carminative, as Cubebs, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damoms, Peppers, Caſtorium, Acorus, Aniſe and Fennel Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Opium contradicts all; for that, beſides other things, makes the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine unfit in Windy Diſtempers. This clearly confutes thoſe that make one Medicine to be proper for all Diſeaſes, when each quality doth only oppoſe its contrary.</p>
                     <p>I ask whether one ounce of Caſtor, or of Galbanum, or of Valerian Roots, given alone, would not do more, then to mix either of them with four times ſo much of that that is improper, and then give but one ounce for a doſe?</p>
                     <p>I know divers may flie to that falſe <hi>Aſylum</hi> or refuge, Experience in this caſe touching Mithridate: I have obſerved it, and nothing is done by it, but ſuch as in all likelyhood Nature would have effected, or elſe it makes no mutation at all commonly, or people grow worſe: Tradition is the only plea, not experience; for experience, not phantaſtically and conceitedly taken, will not vindicate it; but abundance of Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93369:22"/> have we generally received in ſeveral Diſpenſatories, only meſſes of altogether; and how rediculouſly are they compoſed and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? We ſhould read to judge, not to learn of Tradition in ſuch caſes, when we think our ſelves fit to practiſe; for Tradition doth many times conſent only in diſſenting; he that only reads, and remembers what he hath read, to go by, and to juſtifie his practice, is not fit to be a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician; but he that can demonſtrate all his proceedings upon grounds and accounts of his own; for what he remembers he hath read, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans wit, none of his; and he ſhall hardly find three Patients in ten that he can tell how to compare to Practical Chapters of Phyſick touching Diſeaſes; and if he hath no ground of his own to regulate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, he may go to a wrong Chapter, as well as a right. I have uſed to charge Compoſitions well with the Specificals I truſted to, and to have a great care they were in their full force and virtue; for other things that are but ſweetners and Vehicles, it is no great matter what virtue they have: I have chiefly truſted to Simples commended by <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rards</hi> and other Herbals, for they were experienced good in ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers they are praiſed; alſo I drew out all the choice Remedies for Simples I could find in thoſe Authors I had, and ſuch I did affect to uſe for Compoſitions: he that knoweth good Simples, may make good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. Yet even in Diſeaſes of Contagion and epidemical, we muſt take away Impediments, elſe our Alexipharmicalls will not take place. In ſome vomiting is good to clear the Stomach, which may hinder our Cure; ſo the foulneſs, ſtoppages, and putrified Matter in the ſmall or great Guts, muſt be took away by Lenitives in Malignant Diſeaſes, elſe ſuch Impediments will hinder the taking place of other things; So it is apparent in Chyrurgery, that the Chyrurgions Office is only to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Natures Impediments; he cannot heal, Nature doth that: the Similar and Homogenious parts in Ulcers and Wounds deſire to unite, were the Impediments took away, as is Foulneſs, Sanies, Apoſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sarcoſis or Excreſcent Fleſh, Pain, Swelling, Heat, Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Afflux of Humours. There are ſome Medicines indeed glew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and glutinative, but theſe cannot heal, but draw together the Lips of Wounds, and ſo united parts grow together; yet alſo they glutinate and draw up Orifices of corrupted ſores, and ſo the bottom being foul, a worſe is made, and an hollow Ulcer; ſo that nothing properly can be termed an Healer, only they all do their Office, ſome one way, ſome another, to take away Natures Impediments: all the beſt Medicines in the world ſhall not cure ſome Ulcers, eſpecially, not till ſuch a time, and then perhaps a trivial thing, or Nature on her own accord will do it; for if we ſtrive when Nature is not diſpoſed, in all Diſeaſes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93369:22"/> we do nothing, Nature alone will do more: the Stars are a principal cauſe; for if any one be wounded or bruiſed at ſuch or ſuch a time, he will not be healed of a long time, and till that time come all our Arts and Remedies never ſo choice ſhall not avail; and when the time is come, an old Womans Plaiſter, or ſome petty thing chances to cure it. In ſome tumors no ſuppurating Plaiſter or Oyntment will make them ripen that are not naturally, ſpecially at that time, diſpoſed to ripen and ſuppurate; and in others, no diſcuſſing or diſſolving Topicalls will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from ripening; ſo that if we chance not to light of the right time, and to aſſiſt Nature in that way ſhe is diſpoſed and inclined; yet in many tumors, ſpecially if we wait, in ſome longer, in ſome a ſhorter time, Diſcuſſion is made by Diſcutients, and Suppuration by Matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; becauſe Nature was thereto <hi>ſuaptè,</hi> inclined or diſpoſed, or elſe did ſtand neuter; and ſo by outward force, as by a weight put into Scales that were even, the Ballance was turned.</p>
                     <p>In Exanthemata and moſt Eruptions &amp; Tumors, the proper way next to ſweating is, to uſe Topicalls, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to open the Pores, and let out the evil Quality or Heterogenious Spirit of the Diſeaſed Matter, ſpecially in malign Puſtules and Tumors; for the malign Quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evaporated by inſenſible Tranſpiration, the Maſs left is inſipid and void of Heterogeneity, and ſo is ſucked up again by the Veins, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Blood; for inimicalls love not to be joyned together.</p>
                     <p>I have obſerved in the uſe of Dialthea Oyntment, Oyl of Lillies, of ſweet Almonds, and ſome like hereto, that ſwellings anointed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, make their dimenſions and extenſions the larger, ſpecially if we do anoint farther then the ſwelling reaches, and before the matter is fixed, while it is fluxible and thin,; for though theſe Diaphoreticalls and Emollients are very proper to let out the fiery ſharp or Inimical Spirits of the humour that cauſed the Blood to ſeparate it, and throw it off upon a part weakeſt, and that could not repel, and nigheſt; yet they looſen the ſubjected fleſh, and make the capacity larger for the humor to ſwim in, and the skin to be diſtended; yet we muſt not look any thing ſhould happen alike in all; we are ſure the Medicines have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſuch virtues, and connatural operations; but the difference is in the Body, and there is agreement only as to diſagreement; yet we may properly ſay, <hi>(denominatio ſumitur a majori)</hi> that ſuch is the ordinary courſe of Nature, that happens moſt frequently amongſt ſo many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties and diverſities.</p>
                     <p>Reader, what ever I deliver, that I do not prefix or annex to it, <hi>I think, I think, It is probable,</hi> or the like, thou mayeſt take for a ſure
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93369:23"/> and ſound Truth; for I have not given my ſelf to believe Tradition or any Opinions of men, but have judged them, and brought them to the Bar of ſure Experience; and where I could not find two or three good and infallible witneſſes in Nature for them, I rejected them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the courſe of Nature in other things did not harmonize and hold therewith.</p>
                     <p>I do not deſire any man ſhould believe any thing becauſe I believe it; let him believe the Experiences, Examples and Hiſtories that men have in divers Ages and Countreys conſentaneouſly writ; no projects of their own Brain, nor Imaginations; for that hath ſpoiled all Learning every where, becauſe men will not contemplate the works of GOD, and know all the Secrets and Varieties in the wonderful courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the real effects of a GOD. How would men agree in all Points of Religion, and of Opinion concerning GOD, and how <hi>He</hi> is to be worſhipped, what <hi>He</hi> is, and wherefore <hi>He</hi> made this World, and the Office of Man, did they truely and really (void of all fond Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Imaginations) adhere to the courſe of Nature, and ſearch her? Doubtleſs God did not give a Rational Faculty to Man, to deceive and entrap him; and we ſee what one Eye apprehends black or white, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth; and what one Pallate taſtes ſweet, another doth; and what one Ear hears ſound ſhrill or loud, another doth; and what one Noſe ſmells unſavory, another doth; and what one Hand touches hard or ſoft, the Hand of another feels it ſo; I mean purely according to Nature: Then let us conclude theſe things are all true, and really ſo, that the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Nature of Man conſents to own and approve of; and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are queſtionable, and muſt be brought to the Bar of ſure Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, to be tried: for GOD gave us not our Senſes, Hearing, See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Smelling, Feeling, and Taſting, to deceive, and entrap, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found us: All mankind might be ſatisfied in one Religion, as well as in unanimity in Philoſophy, were things cleared, that one mans Eye might ſee them as well as another; no man ſurely would deny Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he could both ſee, hear, feel, taſte, or ſmell himſelf: So the Doctrine of Spirits is writ by the experience of many men; and did not the ſelf-ſame things happen in our Age and Countrey, we might diſtruſt Tradition: When we hear men ſay they ſaw ſuch things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they were addicted to no fond belief, and in all other things ſtaid and prudent, we may have reaſon to believe them.</p>
                     <p>2.

                        </gap>, Choler, Melancholy, or black Choler: But that the Reader may know the truth, we ſhall give theſe Exceptions:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That the Names are onely Figments and Phancies of Men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That Nature obſerves no Method or Order herein, as, that that Humour that is not Flegm, muſt be Melancholy; or that that is not truely Melancholy, according to Phyſicians Deſcription thereof, muſt be Water; and that Humour that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds not with either of theſe, according to Ancient Rules and Authorities, muſt be Choler: There is no ſuch thing in Nature. As for Example: Melancholy by its Name ſignifies black Choler; by their Attributes it muſt be black, and a kind of Choler, it muſt be fluid and thin; by the taſte, ſay they, tart; by nature of mutation, Scirrhous, and apt to grow faecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: I anſwer, We may finde an Humour that is black, and very bitter; in the one it accords with Melancholy, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Choler; what then ſhall we call it? Another Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is found black, thin like Water, not coagulative; what ſhall we call this? alſo ſweet in taſte, ſo that the taſte agrees with Flegm, the conſiſtence with Water, the colour with Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. So in the generality.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Why ſhould we give Names to Humours, and thoſe naturally to be ſo qualified, when we finde not ſo in the courſe of Nature, not as a Rule, onely as a Contingent and Accident? For ſuppoſe any Phyſician ſhould open a Mans Head, or other Part, and finde therein the cauſe of his Death to be a gellied Water, black, ſtinking, and inſipid; muſt we therefore write of all mankinde, there is an Humour in all Bodies which we thus call, which is gellied, black, ſtinking and inſipid, when we may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find exactly the ſame again? For in another that is diffected, we may find the blackneſs of an humour, but not the abſence of taſte; or the gelliedneſs of an humour, and not the blackneſs; or the ſtinking of an humour, and not the gelliedneſs: and ſo it is as purely accidental
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93369:24"/> that we meet with Flegm, Choler, Water and Melancholy in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, eſpecially Choler and Melancholy, juſt as they deſcribe: Water in the bellies of Hydropicks agrees the moſt together, and in all may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called Water; yet in ſome it is thicker, in others thinner; in ſome clear, in others yellow, in others blackiſh; in ſome ſtinking, in others ſweet, in ſome bloody; ſo that it is hard to ſay whether it is wateriſh Blood, or bloody Water: and in other parts of the Body, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (if it be good to uſe ſuch a general name to expreſs our ſelves) differs more, ſo that it is hard to ſay whether it be wateriſh Choler, or a chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Water; or a wateriſh Flegm, or a flegmatick Water; or a water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Melancholy, or melancholy Water: They that intend to be ſais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Truth alone, and to acquieſce therein, had beſt build their Faith on ſure Foundations, and read Obſervations, Anatomies and Diffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſider all from what they can experience, or what many others have experienced, not conjectured.</p>
                     <p>I think it the beſt way to teach any, to let them read onely Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Experiences, and Similitudes, and therefrom, with their own conſideration, and comparing one thing with another, make general Rules and Tenents in Philoſophy. What man can imagine (that did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver experience himſelf, or read, or hear it to have been experienced) that there is ſuch variety in fire? that ſome fire will burn and not be ſeen; and ſome look like flame, and yet not burn; that ſome ſhould be quenched with Oyl, and kindled with Water; that ſome ſhould burn in the depth of the Earth, and in the Sea, and in Lakes; that Wood rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed together ſhould burn; that Fire ſhould be procured from a Glaſs of Water ſet in the Sun, Toe laid betwixt, and many ſuch things: It is not fit men ſhould write of a thing, that know little thereof, onely conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturally; for therein men loſe their time and pains, and cannot aſſert any thing but from ſuch a mans <hi>ita dixit,</hi> or <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> or ſo many men are of that minde, when by experience the thing might be put out of all diſpute.</p>

I have well conſidered it; and he that knowes theſe things, and doth well conſider, and compare, ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, find that the contingents and things on earth, that happen to, and are in and about Man, come and fall out juſt according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and order of the Heavenly Bodies; and what detraction can it be from God, or Heterodoxity to ſay, <hi>The one is governed or guided by the other,</hi> being we ſee aſſuredly they do ſo fall out, and have their current and ordinary natural motion ſo and in that manner? for every thing hath its cauſe; and if good comes immediately from God without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene of contingent and natural Cauſes, ſo then would Evil be made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately wilfully and partially to ariſe from God, if it did not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally according to the Order of Nature ſo fall out; which Order in Nature God hath committed to the courſe of the wandring Stars, ſo far as our reaſon and knowledge, experience and capability can reach; which courſe of the Planets God at firſt made, and that is the wonder they have ever ſince continued it; and he knew how they would change and vary, and what and when, and how things would be changed and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                  <p>There may be many exceptions made which in one place or other of our Writing, or Scripture, we have endeavoured to give ſatisfaction in.</p>
                  <p>In all Schemes we muſt compare one thing with another; ſor as in the Heavens are good and bad and indifferent Signs, ſo in one ſick Body, ſome Signs ſhew Shortneſs, ſome protraction of the Diſeaſe, ſome ſhew Death, ſome Recovery, and ſome are neither.</p>

                  <p>Moreover, in all Changes we muſt ſee what Planets afflict the <hi>Moon,</hi> and Lord of the Aſcendant and ſixth Houſe, and judge of the Humour accordingly: <hi>Saturn</hi> governs the Petrifying, Scirrifying, groſs and earthy Spirit in Man: <hi>Mars</hi> governs the fiery ſharp thin Evaporative and cauſtick Quality in Man: the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> chiefly govern the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guifick Quality in Man, the <hi>Sun</hi> more properly the Sanguifick Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Heart; the Liver and Venal Blood are given to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and animifick Qualities.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> gives Wateriſhneſs and Moiſture, ſpecially encreaſing; decreaſing ſhe decreaſes it: <hi>Venus</hi> chiefly governs the Spermatifick Quality; and <hi>Mercury</hi> the Senſe or Rationality of the Brain; but <hi>Venus</hi> gives Flegm chiefly; <hi>Mercury</hi> inclines the Way, or that, as he is conjoyned with others.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall next proceed to the Aſtrological Cure of all Diſeaſes, and treat as briefly thereof as we may conveniently.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſeaſe is cauſed by <hi>Saturn,</hi> we may cure by Sympathy with a Plant of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> for they are friends to <hi>Saturn;</hi> or we may cure a Diſeaſe cauſed by <hi>Saturn,</hi> by Antipathy, by a Plant of <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> his enemies.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Jupiter</hi> cauſe the Diſeaſe, or be Lord of the ſixth, or afflict the Lord of the Aſcendant at Decumbiture, all Medicines cure by Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; all the Planets being by Aſtrologians reckoned friends to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but <hi>Mars,</hi> and a Plant of <hi>Mars</hi> may cure by Antipathy.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Mars</hi> cauſe the Diſeaſe, or be Lord of the Sickneſs, that is cured by Sympathy by a Venerial Plant; by Antipathy by Medicines gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any of the other Planets; yet in this caſe, the Sympathy with <hi>Venus</hi> is of greater force than the Antipathy of <hi>Mars,</hi> with the reſt of the Planets.</p>
                  <p>A Diſeaſe of the <hi>Sun</hi> is beſt cured by a Plant of <hi>Saturn</hi> antipatheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, for <hi>Saturn</hi> alone is his enemy; but by Sympathy by a Plant of any of the other Planets, indifferent friends with him.</p>
                  <p>A Sickneſs cauſed or governed by <hi>Venus,</hi> is beſt cured by Antipathy, by a Plant of <hi>Saturn, Contraria contrarijs curantur;</hi> but the Plants of all other Planets being friends, if they cure it is by Sympathy.</p>
                  <p>A Sickneſs cauſed by <hi>Mercury,</hi> is cured ſympathetically by a Plant of <hi>Jupiter, Venus</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> being his friends; antipathetically, by Plants or Drugs or Minerals of <hi>Sol, Mars</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> being <hi>Mercuries</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:93369:29"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is to be conſidered, that we drawing a Scheme at the ſick mans deſire, or at his Decumbiture, or firſt viſit, or water ſent, or the like, we muſt conſider the Lord of the tenth Houſe, ſignifying the Medicine, and Lord of the ſeventh, ſignifying the Phyſitian: if the Lord of the tenth be a Fortune and ſtrong, give a Plant that is governed by him, or Plants, elected as we ſhall ſhew in the following note or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but if the Lord of the tenth Houſe, or the Houſe of Phyſick, be weak, afflicted, or in a <hi>Quartile</hi> Aſpect, or oppoſite to the Lord of the Aſcendant or ſixth houſe, and be alſo an Infortune, which makes it the worſe, give not a Medicine that is governed by him, for that is likely to do harm; no nor give any thing at that time, not until the Lord of the tenth is well dignified, or a new and friendly Lord of the tenth ariſe by mutation of Signs, and alſo a well-dignified and qualified Lord of the ſeventh, and that are in good Aſpect, and nigh as may be with the Lord of the Aſcendant and ſixth Houſe; give no Medicine governed by the Lord of the eighth, or houſe of Death: every Artiſt muſt look to find huge variation in the heavenly Bodies; and rarely all theſe good Signs or Aſpects can be found together, theſe are not enough to give directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs men have ſtudied the Grounds and Rudiments of Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the Aſtrological Cure of Sickneſs, we muſt not only give a Plant, Mineral, Gum, Stone, or Animal governed by ſuch a Planet that is at ſympathy with the Planet cauſing or governing chiefly the Sickneſs, or a Plant of another Planet, Antipathetical to the Planet ruling the Diſeaſe, nor yet a Plant of either of the aforeſaid Planets ſympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or antipathetick, though it be ſtrong and Lord of the tenth houſe, unleſs it be ſomewhat proper to remove the cauſe, or oppugn the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, groſneſs, wateriſhneſs, ſtonineſs, vermifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>As for Example; <hi>Mercury</hi> is Lord of the ſixth <hi>Houſe;</hi> a Vertigo, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, or depraved Ratiocination is the Diſeaſe; we would cure it by ſympathy or antipathy; ſee the Lord of the tenth, or <hi>Houſe</hi> of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, he is <hi>Mars,</hi> he is ſtrong and well aſpected to <hi>Mercury;</hi> well then, give a Plant, Stone, Mineral, Animal, or other kind of Medicine that is under the dominion of <hi>Mars,</hi> but not any Plant, Stone, Mineral or Animal, but ſuch as experience ſhews proper, and reaſon demonſtrates to be oppoſite qualitied to the Quality of the Humour, Matter or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour cauſing the Diſeaſe: obſerve Phyſical Experiences, what Medicines have been found to cure in ſuch caſes, and then look which of theſe are under the dominion of <hi>Mars,</hi> or which of thoſe Plants under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Mars</hi> are found available in ſuch caſes, for Plants of other
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93369:30"/> Planets have alſo been uſed, and have done good ſometimes in thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that will not help another; and that is a great reaſon, why one is cured by this, another not eaſed by that, yet is by another thing, as nigh to the formers Mans condition as may be.</p>
                  <p>Other Books muſt direct what Plants, Stones, Minerals, Animals are governed by ſuch and ſuch Planets: yet herein I muſt needs condemn Aſtrology; for Aſtrologians have not queſtioned theſe things on good Grounds, and certain and manifold Experience, and do differ in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein: Indeed for many Drugs it is hard to learn by any Rima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Experience, what Planets they are peculiarly ruled by; all ſuch ought to be gathered when the Planets ruling them, are eſſentially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, as nigh as may be, and given when the Planet governing it, is ſtrong, and well aſpected by the <hi>Moon,</hi> and Lord of the ſixth and firſt Houſes.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if any Planet be Lord of the ſixth, ſtrong, and well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, a Plant of his own may help that Sickneſs by ſympathy.</p>
                  <p>As for example; the <hi>Sun,</hi> the heat of the world, ſympathizes with the Heart, the <hi>Sun</hi> and heat of Mans Microcoſm, the <hi>Sun</hi> may cauſe ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Heart panting and lypothimy; then obſerve what Plants the <hi>Sun</hi> governs, and chuſe out ſuch as have been found good not only in general for the Heart, but in particular for ſuch Diſtempers of it; and thoſe Medicines may be, Balm, Saffron, Rhue, Marigolds, Piony, <hi>Ros Solis,</hi> Roſemary, and Wine.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſhall divide Diſeaſes of the Brain into two parts:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Diſeaſes of Senſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diſeaſes of Motion.</p>
                  <p>The firſt we ſhall divide into two parts:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Diſeaſes of Stupidity and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Diſeaſes of aggravated Senſe or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond we ſhall alſo divide into two parts:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Diſeaſes of Motion leſſened or aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Into Diſeaſes of Motion depraved: So that under theſe two, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, Depravation, or Abolition of Senſe and of Motion, we ſhall comprehend a Diſcourſe of all the Diſeaſes of the Brain.</p>
                  <p>I. For Diſeaſes of Stupidity or Aſtoniſhment: The Ancients were pleaſed to call them <hi>Coma,</hi> or <hi>Carus, Catalepſis,</hi> or <hi>Cataphora, Apoplexia,</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:93369:31"/> and <hi>Lethargus, Subeth Araborum,</hi> &amp;c. And now ſeeing they ordained Nature a courſe to go in which ſhe doth not obſerve, we ſhall finde ſomewhat to examin:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tradition ought not quite to be rejected, nor ſuperſtitiouſly protected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ancients, and Moderns that danced after their Pipes, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh and ordain the differences, and kindes, and degrees of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotical Diſeaſes, to be thus and theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> that is, a privation of ſenſe and motion in the whole body, from a thick flegmatrck humour in the brain, difficult breathing, and ſtertor; the two chief inſeparable ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Catalepſis,</hi> or <hi>Catoche,</hi> ſaid the Ancients, were another kind of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, or ſtupor, wherein of a ſudden all the faculties of the Soul, and motions of the Body periſhed, the Sick lying in that very ſtate wherein he was firſt taken, neither ſpeaking nor hearing, ariſing from a cold and dry diſtemper, not of the ſubſtance, but hinder ventricles of the brain for the moſt part.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A <hi>Coma,</hi> or <hi>Cataphora,</hi> (ſome of the Ancients differed in the names, and which two ſhould be put together, as nigh related) a propenſity to ſleep ſo earneſtly, that the ſick cannot open their eyes: they diſtinguiſhed betwixt <hi>Coma vigilans</hi> and <hi>Somnolentum,</hi> thus; in the <hi>vigilans Coma</hi> they cannot hold open their eyes, but are awake; in the <hi>Somnolentum</hi> they both ſhut their eyes and ſleep: the cauſe, they ſaid, was a ſtrong refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration of the brain, from a flegmatick humour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Carus:</hi> This, ſaid the Ancients, is a ſudden immobility and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs of the whole body, the breathing being free, whereby it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from an Apoplexy, from a Lethargy by abſence of a Feaver, and becauſe in this the ſick anſwer not, but in Lethargies commonly have that reaſon and power; the cauſe, they ſaid, was Flegm, or a cold hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour obſtructing the fore ventricles of the brain.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A <hi>Lethargy:</hi> In which Reaſon and Memory were impaired, if not abſolutely defunct, an irreſiſtible neceſſity of ſleeping, a Feaver from putrified flegm in the ſubſtance not ventricles of the brain. We might adde a ſixth, and that is, loſt Memory, from a cold diſtemper and flegm.</p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Johannes Johnſtonus</hi> in his <hi>Idea Medicinae Practicae,</hi> hath many choice diſtinctions of all Diſeaſes, whereby Truth is exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, and the Reader the better underſtood of theſe things; yet he did follow Tradition, as <hi>Sennertus</hi> chiefly, who is a far better Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Preſident for Truth, than <hi>Galen, Hippocrates, Celſus, Aetius, Aegineta, Rhaſis, Avicen,</hi> and other Ancients.</p>
                  <p>If any man will object againſt me that the Diſeaſes of the brain are
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93369:31"/> ſuch and onely ſuch, and in that degree and manner, and in no other than what the Ancients and Moderns have delivered in their practices of Phyſick, I ſhall wiſh him to obſerve twenty or thirty of the next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients he meets with, and ſee if their caſes correſpond with the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Diſeaſe he thinks theſe have: ſo alſo for the Cauſe, let any man open twenty or thirty (for in ſo many, if there be any Method and Order in Nature, it may be found out) and let him ſee if the cauſes were ſuch or ſo many, and onely ſuch and ſo many, in that place and degree the Practicks have delivered: It is ſure Nature obſerves ſome Orders, but it is not as to the Bodies of things, but their Spirits; a Narcotick quality in any matter, as Water, or Blood, or Cholerick looked corruption, will cauſe a <hi>Coma, Carus,</hi> loſt Memory or Lethargy, and in what part ſoever, if it may be communicated to the brain, it will aſtoniſh ſenſe: Whence is the force of the Torpedo or Crampfiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated at ſuch a diſtance? how doth the Lye of the Salt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood aſtoniſh the hands? bitter <hi>Opium</hi> is Narcotical, and nautious Henbane; the fume of Charcoal in a cloſe Room makes ſleepy, hot Spirit of Wine makes drunk like dead for ſeveral days: <hi>Platerus</hi> hath a notable Hiſtory of one dead drunk with being in a Wine Cellar, that working, and he cloſed up: by Thunder, Air, and ſome Baths, are men made ſtupid: Whatſoever hath a Narcotick quality, it oppoſes the Brain, becauſe the Brain alone of all the Body contains its contrary; it is a quality oppoſite to ſenſe and motion, which the Brain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                  <p>Theſe procatarctick and outward cauſes do nothing, unleſs they work upon the inward; for all are not alike made to ſleep with <hi>Opium,</hi> or aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Spirit of Wine; all are not made Apoplectick with a box of the Ear, or ſudden fright, and yet ſome have: Nature abounds with variety, and in every ſick perſon almoſt we finde ſomewhat ſingular; and almoſt every other or third caſe is a rarity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If we conſider the inward cauſes of ſtupid, and torpid, and ſleepy Diſeaſes, they ariſe not all from one cauſe, or one matter, it is the Narcotick quality in the humour or matter that benumeth and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; yet I muſt needs ſay this, there is as much variety in the kindes and degrees of aſtoniſhment, as in the cauſe: in ſome there is onely a ſleepy temper and dulneſs. <hi>Marcellus Donatus</hi> brings two examples of thoſe that ſlept many years together, and had no illneſs or Diſeaſe: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing hath its extream of little, and extream of much, and <hi>Medium</hi> or <hi>Mediocrity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some when they have been opened, have had a ball of viſcous flegm in the Brain, that did dull and ſomnify the Brain; others opened have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93369:32"/> had their Brains looſe and wateriſh, and ſcattered as it were; others opened have had an abſceſs and purulency found in the fore part of their Brain, that did die Lethargically; others about the Ophthick Nerve have had a purulent abſceſs and ſlimy water, others from Worms; and we ſee Children that have Worms, or rather a ſweet mild humour pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, are ſleepy; ſo in fits of the Mother, ſome lie 2 or 3 days ſtone dead as it were: In two diſſected were found water; in one reddiſh, in the orher paler, in both in the hinder part of the head; and the Veins that ran from the fore to the hinder part of the head, full of black blood: In Apoplecticks the head being opened, blood hath flowed forth like Ink; in another Apoplectick, a thick and viſcous humour is found nigh the Context retiform in the head: In the heads of other ſtupid perſons have much glutinous but clear water been found in the brain; ſo that however it looks, if a Narcotick quality is in it, it makes ſtupid and ſenſeleſs; or in what part ſoever a Narcotick quality is, it oppoſes it ſelf to the brain; for <hi>Opium</hi> lies in th Stomach or Guts, when it raiſeth ſleepineſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet this we will allow the Ancients, that where an humour looks black or red, commonly there is not a Narcotick quality in it, as in flegm or glutinous water, not that the colour impedes the quality, but the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the colour; for a fiery Spirit in an humour, makes it high coloured, and ſharp taſted, and ſtrong ſcented.</p>
                  <p>I ask what makes the aſtoniſhment? if they ſay the coldneſs and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſhneſs of the humour; I anſwer, Blood and viſibly Choler cauſed it: if they ſay ſuch a thing; I ask why it is not found in all? for aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in all theſe, and that that cauſed the Aſtoniſhment was in all theſe; but neither thinneſs or thickneſs of the humour, aquoſity or viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſity, redneſs or paleneſs, taſte or odour was in them alike; therefore they did conduce nothing thereto, onely to be fit Bodies for a Narcoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal qualified Spirit to be ſeated in: Indeed often in Apoplexies, blood by blows or falls, ſtopping up all the paſſages of the animal Spirits, and compreſſing the Brain, cauſes ſtupidity, but not commonly in ſtupidity and drowſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Poſſibly abundance more might be found in Authors, that have been opened, dying of ſtupid and ſomnorous Diſeaſes; but in theſe what ſhall we conclude (to go on in the Rules of the Ancients) is the Cauſe? if we ſay Flegm, ſome were found to have clear water; if we ſay wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſome were found to have black blood; if we ſay black blood, ſome were found to have viſcous purulency or mature; if we ſay viſcous puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency or ſanies, ſome were found to have pure uncorrupted gelly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant; if we ſay pure tranſparant gellied water is the cauſe, ſome
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93369:32"/> were found, as in the comunicated Obſervations to <hi>Riverius,</hi> to have a black ſtinking humour like Ink, that cauſed ſottiſhneſs and fooliſhneſs; in others it ſeems balls of Flegm have been in the ſubſtance of the Brain, and the Brain hath been wateriſh, and diſſolved, and looſe in others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To particularize on any one of theſe, how ſhall we hold with <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> touching the four humours? for if we ſay Flegm is white, thick and ſweet; Choler yellow, thin and bitter; Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly black, faeculent and ſowr; Water clear, thin and inſipid; where or when ſhall we find Flegm, Choler, Water, or Melancholy the cauſe of Diſeaſes? It is by as great an accident that we finde Humours juſt thus qualified and principled, as any other thing: and why ſhould the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients make Poſterity believe that moſt commonly, for that ſhews a thing moſt natural, Flegm, Choler, Water, and Melancholy, or Blood, as ſome will have, are the cauſe of all Diſeaſes? for where once we ſhall find an humour pure Flegm, or pure Choler, or pure Melancholy, or pure Water, as the Ancients deſcribed, we ſhall find them ten times contrary; ſo that it will be hard to ſay, whether they come nigheſt the nature of Choler, or Blood, or Water, or Melancholy; for if they have the taſte of one, they want the colour; if the colour, they want the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; if the conſiſtence, they want the ſmell; if the ſmell they have, they want the Virtue, Nature, Quality or Properties of that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall not here ſhew all the diverſity of ſigns and differences in Stupid and Somnolent Sickneſſes: The Ancients ſhould have done well to have called all Stupid or Somnolent Sickneſſe, and ſo have made diſtinction according to obſervation; but deſcribing onely five kindes, as, <hi>Lethargy, Apoplexy, Catalepſis, Coma</hi> and <hi>Carus,</hi> and they to be ſo as we have deſcribed, the Reader is much deceived: for, for any to be ſick of any Torpid or Somnolent Diſeaſe juſt as they have deſcribed, is very rare; and why ſhould they deliver that as a common Rule and Method in Nature, that is as accidentary and caſual as any thing? for to which can we refer many Soporous Sickneſſes? neither Lethargies, becauſe they ariſe from another cauſe than what the Ancients did ſet; and not Apoplexies, becauſe they hold them in a different manner: ſo that neither in the Cauſe or Symptoms are they exactly referrable to any of their Names, nor perhaps Natures.</p>
                  <p>II. We ſhall treat of the Sickneſs of the Brain, wherein is an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Senſe, and exaltation of the Spirits, contrary to the other of Stupidity and Drowſineſs.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:93369:33"/>
                  <p>The Ancients, and alſo Moderns, call them <hi>Phrenitis, Mania,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phrenitis,</hi> ſay they, is a continual raging, with a ſharp Feaver, wherein the Imagination alone, ſometimes the Reaſon is hurt, from an Inflamation of the Membranes, or the Brain it ſelf; therein is, ſay they, a ſtoppage of Urine, breathing ſmall and frequent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mania,</hi> ſay they, is a fury <hi>tiuturne</hi> with boldneſs and fierceneſs, from the fire of the Spirits moved, or yellow Choler burnt; as <hi>Etius</hi> ſaith, from putrified blood: there is no Feaver in this, ſome ſay, becauſe there is no putrefaction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melancholia,</hi> ſay they, is a raging without a Feaver, with Fear and Sadneſs; without a Feaver from a melancholy humour, which they ſaid was either in the Head it ſelf, or did in vapour ſteem up thither, as from the Hypoconders and Spleen. This ſhort deſcription I take, as moſt generally received by the Moderns from the Ancients; but to go to ſearch how all differed, might find an induſtrious and wiſe man ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient tediouſneſs; in many things indeed they agreed onely in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing; and ſometimes both were right, and ſometimes neither: for there is ſuch wonderful variety, that if they all differed, as it might be, they might all write true.</p>
                  <p>Now we will examine all the kindes of aggravated Senſe, and ſee if they be onely ſo many and ſuch as the Practical Phyſicians have writ Chapters of; and we will ſee if that Delirium or raving that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous to the deſcription of <hi>Mania,</hi> be <hi>Phrenitis;</hi> and if that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction that is not a <hi>Phrenitis,</hi> be <hi>Melancholia;</hi> and we will obſerve whether Nature obſerves any ſuch Method, that if a diſtraction or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging be not in the Symptoms, Cauſe, Manner, and Meaſure of a <hi>Mania,</hi> it muſt be a Phrenſie; if it be not correſpondent with the Signs and Cauſes of a Phrenſie, it muſt be a Melancholy: Alſo we will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, if it be a Madneſs, whether commonly it is exactly ſo, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally; or whether in one ſick Perſon moſt familiarly, which is moſt natural, and ſhould have been writ of accordingly there: Are not Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms ſome of <hi>Mania,</hi> or Madneſs; ſome of <hi>Phrenitis,</hi> or Phrenſie; ſome of <hi>Melancholia,</hi> or Melancholy? or at leaſt, ſome Symptoms argue one, one time; and change of Symptoms argue another Diſeaſe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. Whoſoever diſtruſts the Truth of our Experiments, and Examples, and Anatomies, may be ſatisfied from <hi>Skenkius,</hi> to go no further; he hath collected abundance of mens obſervations: But to theſe we have added the Obſervations collected from many men, by <hi>Marcell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But why ſhould we inſiſt on theſe things, where there is a multitude of variety in the kinds of all Diſeaſes, and the more we know, the more we ſee we have ſtill to know?</p>
                  <p>Divers are ſtrangely handled, poſſeſſed by the Devil, that do rage and leap, and jump from place to place, whoſe necks are ſometimes twiſted behind them, and Convulſions draw up all their parts; in ſome is a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in ſome not; ſome blaſpheme, and ſome have intermiſſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93369:34"/> they come to themſelves, and ſpeak well, and good things. Some poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed or bewitched, find ſomewhat riſe up in their breaſt as if they ſhould be choaked. And ſome ſee the Witch or her Imp, come in form of a Spider or Beetle, and creep in at their mouths, and then they are hoven, and rage and delire, and are convulſive; and ſome lye as dead ſeveral dayes, and ſome do not ſleep nor eat of divers dayes, that are bewitched or poſſeſſed of evil Spirits.</p>
                  <p>I have ſearched more than moſt men, and I cannot find the Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in all their Orders and Degrees, nor in their million of humbers, do know the mind or thoughts of Man; God alone is <hi>Cardiognoſtes,</hi> it is his Prerogative; nor can they change the mind of Man, but by real poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, or through Witches, or by altering contingents and mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affairs.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall not inſiſt much upon the outward, moving &amp; apparent cauſe we have already in part deſcribed; both the inward Cauſe that is moved by the outward, and the outward Cauſe, being but one and the ſame, in two parties, have different effects; nor is any thing much to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the colour or conſiſtence of an Humour, but an hidden quality in it: for it is apparent that the ſame Humour viſibly that cauſeth the Falling-Sickneſs in one, cauſeth Apoplexies in another, and Palſies and Stupor in another, and in another they ſeemed to all little in the Head, until they were opened.</p>
                  <p>The outward Cauſe of all exacerbated or aggravated ſence, is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Stars operating upon the inward Cauſe, and giving it ſuch a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and a nature at ſuch times to ferment and work, and make Fits and Criſes, even according to the motions of the Planets cauſing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and the <hi>Moon.</hi>

                  <p>Sadneſs, Fears and Scars, Jealouſie, Diſcontents betwixt Man and Wife, the moſt lacerating of all Grief; bitings of Dogs, Wolves, Wines, Strong-Drinks, and Hot-Waters, heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> retained <hi>Semen in Mulieribus,</hi> retained Haemorrhoids, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the foregoing, exciting and procatarctick Cauſes; as alſo loſs of Love, and Diſappointment in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, deſtiny of Friends, and loſs of Eſtates, ſoaring Phantaſms, and deep Excogitations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Now a little of the inward Cauſe of Exacerbated Senſe or Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the Reader may gueſs truly of the reſt, and of other things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Petrus Pamus</hi> Obſ. 8. of Anatomies, opened a Man, that for two years did complain of a pain of his Head in the hinder part, then took with a Phrenſy and Convulſive Motions; he ſuddenly oyed; the thick Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane of the Brain was eaten through with divers holes, chiefly in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93369:35"/> Bregma under the Arrow Suture; from thoſe holes flowed forth hard and thick blood, black and aduſt, very ſtinking throughout that Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane; with the like blood were the Veſſels filled that ran through the Superficies of the thick Meninx, and thorow the ſmall ones of the thin Meninx, that involvs the Brain; in the Cerebel was an Abſceſs of a yellowiſh humour inclining to white; the Cerebel was looſe and ſofter than the Brain.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Tho. Bartholinus,</hi> Cent. 2. Hiſtor. 34. opened one that had been wounded in the Forehead, and died thereof the tenth day; he had an Apoſteme in the Brain, with abundance of Purulency, which did turn the Vicine Parts to black; he died ſleepily and drowſy, nor had he any Delirium, Palſy or feaveriſh Pulſe.</p>
                  <p>Two more there he mentions that had Apoſtemes of the Brain, that differed both from theſe, and from each other: indeed the Part it is in, as well as the Quality of the Matter, is to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jo. Skenkius</hi> from <hi>Neretus Nervitnes,</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi> Phyſician, had this Obſervation; That one was opened that died of a Phrenſy 1583. in the new Hoſpital of <hi>Dom. Mariae,</hi> the Ventricles of his Brain were full of a skie-coloured Water, and the left Ventricle was eaten thorow; <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus Belga,</hi> a Phyſician that ſtood by, taſted of it, and it was very ſharp.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> about the year 1653. died a Gentleman at an Inn, that was Doctor <hi>Synipcots</hi> his Patient; after a feaveriſh illneſs he fell ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and doting, his Feaver ſtill continuing; he hid the Cauſe, till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the laſt he revealed it, that he and ſeveral others had drunk ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters for wagers, and to outvy one another; in His feaver and raging he died; after his death abundance of Blood ran from him out of his Head. See now what varieties there be in the Cauſes of one Diſtemper, and ſee how one Cauſe hath divers effects, commonly drinking much Strong-Waters, or the Spirits of Wine aſtoniſh Men, ſo that they are many times buried alive: and Apoplexies quite contrary to Phrenſies, are apparently cauſed by much and hot Blood, compreſſing the Brain; and Blood in Apoplecticks hath flowen forth as in this Phrenitick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Colter</hi> in his Anatomical and Chyrurgical Obſervations, opened a Womans Head that died of a burning Feaver, ſhe had loſs of Reaſon, and did laugh, jeſt and ſing; Blood that was drawn out of a vein, did look flegmatick, raw and wheyiſh, her Head aked much; after her Head was opened, in the Sawing of the Skull, there did flow out a great deal of Water like the waſhing of raw fleſh, the thin Membrane and <hi>Plexus Choroidis,</hi> were full of thin and pituitous Water, both Ventricles full of Water, no inflamation of the Brain or Involucrums; from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93369:35"/> of the hard Membrane, were ſtrings taken like Worms made of glutinous Flegm; and this he called a Phrenſie.</p>

God that did to all Bodies at firſt give ſuch a Soul, or a Spirit, and to that Spirit a peculiar Quality, can give to Flegm by the ſame way and cauſes, a cauſtick and ſharp Quality, and to red ſpirituous Blood, a Narcotick Principle, or ſtupifactive Quality.</p>

                  <p>Motion is leſſened or aboliſhed in the former Diſeaſes, and by thoſe Cauſes, as in Apoplexies, Lethargies, <hi>Catalepſis, Coma's</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A Palſy, ſaid the Antients, is not in the whole body, but in parts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Brain, ſometimes Senſe, ſometimes Motion, ſometimes both periſh, <hi>viz.</hi> the Senſe of feeling and of acting the parts: the Senſe of feeling may periſh, Motion remaining in that part, and Motion may periſh, feeling remaining; becauſe, ſaid <hi>Galen,</hi> they have two kinds of Sinews, one for motion, one for feeling, and which ſoever are hurt, the office thereof is hurt; ſometimes it is in one half of the body, all the right or left ſide, and parts thereof; ſometimes but in one particular member: the Cauſe was attributed to a cold diſtemper from thick and viſcid Humours, or from bruiſing, wounding, ſcirrh or inflamation of the ſpinal Marrow; it is a Cronical Diſeaſe, not Acute; if the ſpinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be cut or luxated, the Diſeaſe is uncurable.</p>
                  <p>Trembling, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Now let us examine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether the Antients ſet down all the Kindes of Numbneſs and leſſened Motion, or whether. Nature errs allwayes juſt

                  <p>Now let us ſee what is the internal Cauſe of Numbneſs, trembling and deadneſs of Parts, or the whole Body: for we would chiefly inform Phyſicians, ſpecially young Learners, in thoſe things they ſhall ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, being multifariouſly built upon the ſure Baſis of Experience; alſo thoſe things that are of greateſt dignity, and which being known, the rational faculty of man leads him to diſcover Appurtenances, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereto adhering, nor are they ever to be unlearned again, as the Phantaſies and Chimaeras of Mens-Brains are, nor ſhall the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der often meet with ſuch in other Books, and therefore have we chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written in this manner, and theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Of Procatarctick, open, or outward Cauſes in the Kinds of Reſolution, we have ſpoken ſomewhat, and much needs not be ſpoken: it ſometimes follows Cholicks, and Cholicks that; an Air men know not how blaſts and withers, ſometimes one part, ſometimes half the Body, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all, the Body more or leſs ſuffering impair of motion; and ſo hath lightening done, looſing all the Joynts, and melting the Bones.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93369:37"/> and the outward Cauſe differs; ſome tremble from fear, ſome from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement cold; ſome in old age, ſome afore death.

                  <p>I could produce many more ſuch relations of the nature of Plants and Minerals, and Creatures, to raiſe Convulſions, and the varieties of vitiated motion, as alſo all other ails man is ſubject to, but theſe may ſuffice here. We have ſhewed in our Book called <hi>Phyſiology, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſophy</hi> and <hi>Pneumatography,</hi> how man is taken from, and made of the Earth, and how moſt of thoſe Principles are found in his Body; and therefore is it that one Plant ſympathizes with him, and another antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizes; one ſympathizes with ſuch a part of his body, and not another, becauſe in that part is a quality of Homogeneity to the quality of the Plant; ſo ſome Medicines ſpoil one part and not another, becauſe in that part peculiarly is a matter of an antipathetick ſpirit to the ſpirit of the Plant, and ſo they fight: Were there nothing in the body of man of contrary quality to the blood, and ſpirits, and natural Juyces, there would be no Diſeaſes; for Friends and <hi>Conſimilars</hi> do not ſight; that's the reaſon that a poyſon in one man works thus, in another ſo, becauſe the conſtitution and quality of the humours are not the ſame; and as Plants do operate, or Minerals, or Animals on the Body of man vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, according to the various nature of them, and the variety of the ſubject, ſo do humours: for what qualities are in Plants or Minerals heterogenious to the quality of our ſpirits that conſtitutes our vitality, ſenſe, and motion, ſuch may alſo be in the humours, and the humours of themſelves inimically qualified by the air, aliment, or otherwiſe, may raiſe the ſame, and ſuch diverſity of Convulſions, or other Ails whatſoever, as Plants and Minerals, and Animals do.</p>

                  <p>Any matter, as it is a matter, is dead, but the Spirit in it is active and communicable; and eve Spirit, according to the quality GOD gave it, different from others, acts and officiates: Into all pure terrene Bodies, GOD did at firſt according to his good pleaſure, implant a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a peculiar Quality; he could have made Sulphur purging, and Scammony binding; he could have made Rhubarb to have onely a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety for the Head, and Sage, Roſemary and Betony to reſpect pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly the Liver; for the Bodies are nothing but the Spirits they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and the peculiar qualities of theſe Spirits: ſo in mans Body, the humours, to look and conſiſtence, ſmell and taſte, may be the ſame, and yet have many and various qualities,</p>

                  <p>It were an excellent thing, if all Symptoms differing, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to each differing cauſe, and ſo to find out what is the peculiarity of the cauſe, that doth cauſe that diverſity in the condition of two ſick Parties, ſeemingly by the greater and moſt permanent Symptoms, to have one and the ſame Diſeaſe; yet where the parts are alike affected, or humours alike corrupted, the conſtitution will raiſe diverſity.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the cure of all theſe Diſeaſes ſpecified, we will give theſe general Rules and Directions; for indeed in each of thoſe Diſeaſes named, <hi>Carus, Coma, Apoplexia, Subeth, Catalepſis, Memoria, Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, Lethargos, Mania, Melancholia,</hi> and <hi>Phrenitis, Paralyſis, Stupor, Tremor, Convulſio, Epilepſia,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elf ſame cauſe ſeemingly, though of a diverſe quality, works various events; and we have ſufficiently expreſſed by the cauſes, the diverſity of cure in every one of theſe Diſeaſes, for that is the beſt inſight
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93369:40"/> we can give to this credulous Age, and addicted to fond opinion, to ſhew the diverſity of Cauſes, which according to the Vulgar Proverb, <hi>Once known, the Diſeaſe is half cured:</hi> And according to Phyloſophy, <hi>Tolle Cauſam &amp; ceſſabit Effectus,</hi> Take away the Cauſe, and the Effect ceaſeth.</p>
                  <div type="aphorisms">
                     <head>APHORISMS.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. In every Diſeaſe, as the Symptoms vary, ſo the Cauſe; and as the Cauſe varies, ſo in every Diſeaſe our Method muſt vary; for in any ſickneſs there be ſcarce two hold alike in all things.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The Conſtitution eſpecially, but alſo the Age, Cuſtoms and times of the year are to be weighed in the cure of every Perſon, ſo that the method formerly delivered by <hi>Sylvius, Rondeletius, Riverius, Heurnius,</hi> &amp;c. is not ſufficient to learn any to practiſe well and faithfully, unleſs they have diſtinguiſhing knowledge of their own; in ſome, one ounce of the Emetick infuſion will work 20 times, in another ten, in another ſcarce once, in another it works onely downwards; in one, one ſcruple of Jallap is a ſufficient doſe, in another of the ſame age, Sex and ſtrength, one ounce will hardly work, and ſo in the ſame manner for all other Medicines; that that excites one Lethargick will not move another; and that that reſtores Palſies in one, moves no ſenſe of feeling in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the ſenſe of feeling naturally is not alike in all.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Obſerve the Time of the Stars; for if given when Nature doth not co-operate, we do nothing; if Nature draws one way, and our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines pull the other, a confuſion is made.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Obſerve what contradictions there be in all Diſtempers; take away the greateſt of two evils firſt, and that that will be longeſt ere it kill, may be ſuffered longeſt ere cured: Alſo obſerve in curing one infirmity, we do not aggravate or make another; and alſo obſerve what infirmities the ſick uſually was prompt to, and judge that that was uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to him in health, is the leſs dangerous in ſickneſs, yet not without ſome exceptions; alſo obſerve which way the ſick uſed to have his blood purged of Heterogenious matter.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Phyſicians are Natures Servants, and therefore muſt obſerve her Dictates in any of theſe Diſeaſes; we may Purge, or let Blood, or Sweat, or move by Urine, or Salivate, or Synapiſate, or uſe Leeches as we ſee blood abound, and as we finde Nature oppreſſed, or beginning an Excretion ſuch a way, or of ſuch a matter, and in ſuch a place. For Example, If any in a Stupid and ſottiſh Diſeaſe bleeds much at Noſe, hath the Haemorrhoids or courſes that uſed to flow, ſtopped, hath heat of the Body, beating of the Pulſes, ſwelled Veins, though it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93369:40"/> to Phyſicians Directions in ſtupid Diſeaſes to Bleed; yet it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient here in theſe caſes to let blood, and chiefly in the Arteries; or if Arteriotomy may not be allowed, or cannot be celebrated, a Vein of the Forehead, Temples, or behind the Ears, or Jugulars, are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, for they draw immediately from the part; and experience will witneſs for it, againſt thoſe of the Circulation, that in all caſes will bleed in the Arm, becauſe of the community of Veſſels: Furthermore, if in Falling-ſickneſs, Convulſions, Diſtraction, Light-headedneſs, and Melancholy or the like; if any thing break forth by the Ears, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, or any other way; we are to judge the Morbifick matter like to it, and we are to draw it forth by thoſe parts Nature hath begun and ſhewed us the way.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. We muſt endeavour, if we perceive it is a Matter or Humour that doth cauſe the Diſeaſe, to draw it outwardly, and from the more Noble to the leſs Noble Parts; Alſo we muſt obſerve the Emunctories of Nature, in moſt Diſeaſes of the Head, ſhaving of the whole Head, and applying bliſtering Epiſpaſticals were good, particularly behind the Ears, and upon the Sutures; vehement purging will do nothing in a confirmed Diſtemper, and where Humours are ſetled and coagulated, and the Brain corrupted.</p>

This alone, what ever Practical Authors have writ, is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to all perſons in a ſleepy Diſeaſe, and to all perſons in a raging Diſeaſe, and to all perſons in a depravation, or abolition of feeling and motion; to give Specificks, to oppoſe the quality of the Humour, that is Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The only reaſon of theſe things is this, By cuſtom (or otherwiſe by a peculiar Temper) ſuch things eaten, turn the Blood and Juyces into their Nature and Quality, and ſo being Homogenious do not fight, and that is the reaſon of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; one loves one thing, another another, becauſe of a Juyce of ſuch a quality in his Stomach, that ſympathizes and antipathizes with ſuch nouriſhment.</p>

                  <head>A TRACTATE OF THE DISEASES OF THE LUNGS.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been thought, that a Cough, Aſthma, Pleuriſie, Peripneumonia, Empyema, Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moptoe, and Phthiſis were all the Diſeaſes of the Lungs, and that the Lungs had no more, nor no other, according to an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Method in Nature: A Cough is but a Symptome, and may be in all Diſeaſes of the Lungs, and I know not why it ſhould be called a Diſeaſe, for in a Peripneumonia, or inflamation of the Lungs, the cauſe gives the denomination, for in that may be a Cough; ſo Haemoptoe alſo is a Symptom, and may happen in many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and from divers Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Nor have theſe Diſeaſes mentioned juſt ſuch cauſes and no more, or no other then what practical Authors writ.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſave my ſelf the pains to write the Diagnoſtick and Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Signs; as alſo the Cauſes and Method of curing Diſeaſes deſcrubed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93369:42"/> in Practices of Phyſick, they may be compared with what we draw from Obſervations, nigh as well as if they were here writ together or premiſed.</p>
                  <p>The Lungs are the Bellows or Fan of the Heart, the fire of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which they blow up, and keep from dying, falling round about the Heart, filled with Wind, which they draw in and let out, as our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Bellows do; and as ſoon as theſe Natural Bellows ceaſe drawing and letting out of Air; the fire of our Bodies wanting ſomenting and ſtirring up, dies, and we grow cold and pale.</p>
                  <p>The Lungs have alſo another Office, to receive Flegm, and cough it forth, and whereſoever the Lungs burdened cannot cough, we are apt to be choaked.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the two Natural Offices of the Lungs; and we would give inſight to the Reader how many wayes, and how diverſly theſe may be diminiſhed, vitiated or aboliſhed; for properly and plainly, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſhould have deſcribed theſe two, diminiſhed, vitiated or abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and have brought all the ſeveral cauſes, and the ſigns of ſuch particular cauſes, being found by Diffection; and the degrees of each kind, and the variety of Natures Order and Progreſs, and how the Lungs may be affected from other parts by community of Veſſels, or ſuper-incumbency, or affinity of Nature; and Philoſophically they ſhould have deſcribed the peculiarity of the nature of the Lungs, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from other parts, that made them have Diſeaſes different from other parts, they being of a more flegmatick, any and ſpongy Subſtance and Quality.</p>
                  <p>I have known many different kinds, and differing degrees in all thoſe kinds of ſhort breathing, and different cauſes of thoſe different kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> outward and precedent cauſes; for I never ſaw a man opened that died of any Diſeaſe; and ſometimes large eating; the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cruſhed up, and capacity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> ſtreightned, hath cauſed a <hi>Diſnaea;</hi> ſometimes Wind which hath been eaſed, as the former, when the cauſe removed; ſometimes ſwift motion, ſpecially in Green-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, for with motion they are almoſt out of breath in obſtructions, as in the Jaundice and <hi>Cachexia,</hi> they are very ſhort winded, becauſe cold clammy humours do ſometimes abound, and the Thoracical Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles move heavily, and the parts are cruſhed up by windineſs diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which in Dropſies is occaſioned by Water; ſo in Apoplexies breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſhort, or where breathing is not difficult and very ſhort, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it improper to call that ſleepy ſtupid ſickneſs an Apoplexy.</p>

                  <p>By the divers kindes and degrees of ſhort breathing, and the variety of outward and exciting Cauſes, &amp; concomitant Sickneſſes, already ſhewn, may be gueſſed how Coughs, ſpitting of Blood, of Matter, Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs, Pleurifies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do vary in kinde and degree; and are ſometimes ſimple, as a Diſeaſe; or joyned, as a Diſeaſe to another Diſeaſe; or happening as a Symptom in other Ails, or ſupervening: we ſhall quote many Hiſtories and Obſervations of thoſe that have been opened, and withal ſhew the various handling of theſe perſons: ſome were alike, where the Cauſe ſeemed diſalike; and ſome were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing in Diſeaſes, Symptoms, and greatneſs thereof moſt, where by the Cauſe one would think they might be moſt like.

                  <p>IV. <hi>Animalia,</hi> Worms, or various kindes of living Creatures are the Cauſe of many Sickneſſes and Affects, not onely peculiar to other parts, but coincident to the Lungs alſo, and each part Extrinſick as well as Intrinſick, chiefly a pertinacious Cough is ſtirred up by Worms; ſometimes they are joyned with ſtones, and there is ſhort breathing, and pains of the Clavicles; they are ſometimes like Worms in Wood, Maggots, Flies, and ſometimes like Pine-Kernels; more have been caſt up by Cough, in flegmatick matter, then have been found in the Diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: We ſhall not ſtay the Reader in the particular Hiſtories. <hi>Johan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Skenkins, Obſ. Med. pag.</hi> 217. hath collected Authors enow, if any ſhould diſtruſt the Truth, to witneſs it. None could gueſs at
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93369:45"/> Wormes by the Symptomes hardly, except they ſaw the like.</p>
                  <p>V. Coughs are cauſed by things got into the <hi>Traehaea Arteria,</hi> or Lungs; as ſhort and difficult breathing. <hi>Nic. Tulp. Obſ.</hi> 7. of his third Book, relates of a Citizen of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> for ſeven years hugely moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Cough, and very ſtrait breathed, ſo that he grew lean; at laſt with violent Coughing he brought up the ſhell of an Hazel Nut, as big as a mans Finger-Nail, and he was thence-from delivered of his long and tedious Cough and <hi>Dyſpnaea;</hi> it ſtuck about the Head of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> or Wind-pipe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tho. Barth. Hiſt. Med. Cent. 2. Obſ.</hi> 27. relates of a Woman of <hi>Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> that eating Cheſs-Nuts laughed, and it ſeems ſome part got into the Wind-pipe, which ſhe did not know; for two months ſhe was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably afflicted with a Cough, with a Feaver, and waſting of the whole Body; a Phthiſick was feared, divers Phyſicians were adviſed with; at laſt ſhe took a vomitive potion, and brought up the Kernel, and was preſently reſtored to health.</p>
                  <p>VI. The Lungs are ſometime found ſpongy: <hi>Tho. Barth. Hiſt. Med. Anatom. Cent. 3. Hiſ.</hi> 2. found them ſo; they were light like a Feather, yet in ſome parts tied to the ſides; their colour outwardly was good, but inwardly they had little Blood, but Sanies in ſome places iſſued out; his Heart great and full of Blood, ſound; he died conſumptive, ſcarce any fleſh left on his Body: his ſickneſs began with muteneſs, and a great ſwelling under the Chin: Let the Reader in all theſe judge how it is with others, and how one part conſents with another in being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted together, that is more remote, and hath leſs Community of Veſſels many times; and how all being affected in one Body, and one Diſeaſe, they vary each perhaps in the kinde of affection; ſo that it is clear, Phyſick is <hi>Ars Conjecturalis;</hi> and to finde thoſe Diſeaſes Ancients writ of, ſo and no other, and in all things juſt ſo full, is a rarity; for I ſuppoſe ſome of them writ by one caſe how all were, and ſo do the ordinary people; that that cures one, they think muſt cure all; and if died ſo, they pronounce all ſick of that diſtemper (as well as they can gueſs) to die: In this man the Caul was quite conſumed, the Ileon-Gut looked black, the Liver looked dark, the Bladder of Gall ſull, moſt of the parts very ſound. <hi>Hernius</hi> found the Lungs like theſe.</p>
                  <p>VII. Sometimes the Lungs or Lights are found wateriſh, as <hi>Riverius; Cent. 2. Obſ.</hi> 78. A Woman had a ſhort breathing for fifteen years, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing gradually; ſhe had ſometimes a ſwelling of her Cheek, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93369:46"/> Eriſypelas of her Leg, ſhe had ſometimes a falling down of Rheum, which encreaſed her <hi>Dyſpnaea;</hi> ſhe coughed not at all till one day before ſhe died, and that is the wonder, her Lungs being full of water: for how in Dropſies do ſome cough with their <hi>Dyſpnaea,</hi> through the tranſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of water, and ſoaking thereof in the Lungs? With the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs and corruption of the Lungs, the Spleen is found putrified, ſo that with cruſhing it fell in pieces; the right Ventricle of the Heart in the interior part denudated of its Membrane, and looked putrid and exulcerated, the right Auricle large and ſound; and this was a reaſon of the inequality of Pulſe: for in another <hi>Riverius</hi> opened, where was the like inequality of Pulſe, the right Auricle was bigger than wont, and filled with a flegmatick hard concrete ſubſtance: In another he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, an Ulcer in the middle of the Heart cauſed it.</p>
                  <p>VIII. A Dropſie of the Lungs is like to this, but in the purity of the Water, and quantity they vary; and in this the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of the Lungs may not be corrupted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tulpius, lib. 2. Obſ.</hi> 16. A Boy had a moiſt head, and frequent diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, a light Feaver, a Cough, and very difficult breathing, a great ſleepineſs, and often fainting: opened, the Breſt was full of Water, the Lungs hung flaccing, the left Auricle of the Heart eaten with divers Ulcers, a ſtinking humour belching out, which might be the cauſe of the Childs often fainting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>T. Barth. Cent. 2. Hiſt. 7. Thomas Cartier,</hi> a ſanguine man, incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to an atrabilarious temper, laboured of a light Cough, and Feaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs; they encreaſed; he grew Aſthmatical, ſpecially on Nights; his Feet ſwell, Pain troubles his left Side: diſſected, ten pints of putrified and ſtinking Water was found in his <hi>Thorax;</hi> the Lungs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the left part, putrilaginous; the Spleen putrid and ſtinking, in the greateſt part of it; ten or twelve Clots of thick concreted Blood were found in the <hi>Ductus</hi> of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> near the Heart.</p>
                  <p>IX. The Lungs are found in ſome diſcoloured alone; not that the colour cauſeth any thing, but that that cauſed the colour; even as a poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous quality infecting the Body, changes the colour of the inward Bowels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riverlus, Obſ. 87. Cent.</hi> 1. One troubled with <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> pain of the left <hi>Scapula</hi> and Arm, Flux of the Belly, then a Cough, with difficulty of breathing, and after that ſpitting of Blood; Medicines and Bleeding availed not, ſhe ſpat Blood hugely afore Death: Diſſected, the Lungs were white, ſticking to the Ribs, and Midriff, and <hi>Pericardium,</hi> as if
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93369:46"/> one Body; the Heart white and exulcerated, and the matter from that cauſed the Cough, and ſpitting of Blood.</p>
                  <p>He found them livid in another, <hi>page</hi> 155.</p>
                  <p>In an obſervation communicated to him from <hi>Hen. Rufus,</hi> is found, how that a Maid had a long and lingering ſickneſs, melancholy and pale, and ſhort winded, but not likely to die, nor did ſhe lie by it; when ſhe lay down ſhe had ſometimes a dry Cough, no thirſt, ſhe grew weakly; ſhe died, not being thought mortally diſeaſed: many ſpecks or ſpots, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid or red were ſeen; the Lungs had whitiſh circumferential lines, and ſeemed blaſted; all the bowels but the Liver ſafe, that was tainted with Leeky Choler; the <hi>Pleura</hi> and intercoſtal Muſcles were coloured green from an humour; the <hi>Pericardium</hi> void of juyce and putrified; the Heart and Brain ſafe; ſhe ſeldom coughed; the <hi>Pericardion</hi> might affect the vital Spirits in the Heart, and ſo cauſe unexpected death. Many the like may be ſeen in Hiſtories under the other Heads, but we are loth to write one Obſervation twice, though it may witneſs three or four things.</p>
                  <p>X. The Lungs are very frequently found to ſtick to other parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a clammy Subſtance, and flegmatick Nature; in all infirmities of the Breſt, they may ſtick, or adhere, or grow out of order, to one part or other they are nigh, eſpecially too as that part conſents in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pet. Paw.</hi> in a Tabid Perſon opened, found both parts of the Lungs ſticking or growing firmly to the Ribs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tho. Barth. Cent. 3. Hiſt.</hi> 2. in another Tabid or Phthiſical Perſon, found the Lungs, being light and ſpongy, to be grown to the Ribs; and in the 76 <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his 2 <hi>Cent.</hi> a Pthiſical Perſon was opened, the Lungs were void of Blood, and dried, and grew firmly to the Ribs on the right ſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riverius. Obſervat. Cent. 1. page</hi> 84. found in one that died of an Ulcer of the Heart, ſpitting of Blood, Cough, difficulty of breathing, pain of the ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the Lungs were firmly knit to the ribs and <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and <hi>Pericardium,</hi> as if united into one Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Columbus Lib. 15. Anatomiae,</hi> ſaith, <hi>He hath frequently found the Lungs knit to the</hi> Pleura, <hi>ſometimes in one ſide, ſometimes in another, and ſometimes in both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Johannes Bauhinus Obſ.</hi> relates one laboured of a defluxion upon his Lungs and Breſt, a <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> preceeded; he had a Cough, great ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Stomach, belching and <hi>nauſea,</hi> he was diſpoſed to goutiſh and Stone-Cholical pains formerly; dying ſuddenly, and opened, the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93369:47"/> Lungs on the right ſide did cleave to the ſide ſwelled, as if inflamed, the left part ſwam in bloody Water, ſuch as as <hi>Bauhinus</hi> nere ſaw before; in one Kidney was diverſe ſmaller, and one great Stone, the other Kidney waſted; Water was in the Belly; the Stomach that by the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſeemed affected, is not mentioned to be hurt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hercules Saxonia</hi> did find in two, with ſome difference, that the cauſe of their <hi>Aſthma</hi> and ſpitting of Blood, was an inward corruption of the Lungs, and outwardly their growing to the <hi>Pleura</hi> or ſide; but one of them ſeemingly died of a Dropſy.</p>
                  <p>XI. The Lungs or Lights are ſometimes found dryed, and void of Blood, and light, as <hi>Tho. Barth. 76. Hiſt. Cent.</hi> 2. teſtifies, recited before: to which alſo comes the obſervation of <hi>Petrus Spehrerius</hi> afore related.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Bartholinus Cent. 2. Hist.</hi> 35. ſaith, <hi>In Phthiſicks he hath ſeen the Lungs ſo hardned and dryed they might be crumbled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the next obſervation but one, was a diffection of a dropſical par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that coughed, was ſhort winded and Phthiſical; his Lungs were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dry then moiſt, and void of Blood, hanging flaccing.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of theſe things make againſt the Moderns, eſpecially ſuch as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolize the invention of the right wayes the Blood circulates in; they attribute much to the Heart, Spirits, and too ſwift or ſlow motion of the Blood, and other fangles about the Veſſels and their community, which are but ſometime, if at any time, in any meaſure true: Men muſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſtill, that Nature muſt change and alter, as the Vertices of their Brains whirl about.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cent. 2. Hiſt. 76. Tho. Barth.</hi> found in one dying of a Conſumption, the Lungs dryed, void of Blood, and grown to the ſides, and yet much yellow water in the <hi>Thorax</hi> and <hi>Abdomen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XII. The Lungs are found Scirrhous, as all other inward Bowells are; ſometimes full of hard knots, ſometimes they have thick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them; ſometimes like <hi>Atheroma,</hi> ſometimes like <hi>Steatoma,</hi> and ſometimes like <hi>Meliceris;</hi> and ſometimes they have Worms, Stones, and concrete Matter or Blood therein; and ſometimes they are Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and ſometimes pure Caruncles: Yet the Practical Phyſicians wrote only of Scirrhs of the Liver and Spleen, as if they were peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to thoſe parts alone; they are indeed in thoſe parts as well as others, but as rarely ſo, and ſuch as they deſcribe, as any other; ſo that from one or two Obſervations they chanced to ſee, (if they were grounded on Obſervation) <hi>Experientia interdum Fallax;</hi> they laid down the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93369:47"/> of Nature, which Obſervation might be as great a rarity and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar caſe as any, for in the diffected two are not exactly found alike, or at leaſt rarely by one man in all things.</p>
                  <p>Many times a diſpute is more about the ſenſe or ſignification of a Word, or the name of the thing, then any thing elſe; one meaning one thing by ſuch a word, another another; one takes the word from the Genuine ſignification of the Word, or Radix, or that from whence it is derived; another from the common acception, or what ſuch have ſeemed to mean by it; that ſhould alwayes firſt be known what they mean by ſuch Words, or Titles, or names of things, for perhaps thereby they might at firſt underſtand one another, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
                  <p>But the word <hi>Scirrh</hi> was took by the Ancients and Moderns, as it purely ſignifies, being a Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from the Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to make hard; yet they mean not only an hardneſs, but hard ſwellings thereby: Indeed many times the common uſe of a word, this way or that way, makes it proper this way or that way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Johannes Bauhinus,</hi> as we have afore related, found the Lungs har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, but liker a Phlegmone then Scirrh, as the Ancients deſcribed; we ſhall rarely ſee any thing in all points exactly cohere with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Petrus Spehrerius,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Phyſician, found them hard, as afore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but as it were turned into perfect ſtone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Schenckius Filius,</hi> writes of one that had a maſſe of fleſh weighing three pound, that was concreted or hardned, as if the fleſh was laid plate upon plate, and outwardly was a Tumor in the ſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Johannes Heſſus,</hi> in an Obſervation communicated by <hi>Joachim Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius</hi> to <hi>Jo. Schenkius</hi> writes, That one that ſpat Blood with a ſalt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation and Cough was opened, and in his right ſide was found a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercle ſticking to the Lungs, it was large and like a Sponge, ſo that it is appertinent to the ſixth head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nicholaus, Serm. 4. Tract. 2. Cap.</hi> 6. One almoſt ſuffocated, cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a piece of hardned fleſh, large, and other pieces ſmaller, and was eaſed; a year after the ſame ſeemed to be regenerated, and he died, choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Benivenius, cap. 88. de abditis.</hi> A woman ſeemed for a good while, as if ſhe ſhould be choaked or ſuffocated, and ſtopped up; at laſt ſhe fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very troubleſome Cough, and brought up a piece of hard fleſh, and was eaſed quite.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:93369:48"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foreſtus</hi> obſerved an Aſthmatical ſo, by coughing up an hard Caruncle, eaſed.</p>
                  <p>One voided in <hi>Skenkius</hi> a Tabid, that had a Cough diverſe years, with much matter like a fiſhes Bladder or Swimmer, as ſome; <hi>Lohoch Sanum,</hi> and <hi>de pulmone Vulpis,</hi> &amp;c. did no good till this came up.</p>
                  <p>We may reduce things to Heads, but in all theſe heads are ſo many varieties, that they are ſcarce reduceable under any one name, they do ſo vary; ſo that it is hard to ſay, whether they belong to this or that kind, or to any, or whether they are a <hi>Genus</hi> by themſelves, or a <hi>Species</hi> of ſome ſtrange and different <hi>Genus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Skenk. pag.</hi> 218. hath gathered two Obſervations,</p>
                  <p>One from <hi>Hollerius:</hi> One died of a Dropſie of the Breſt, a Cough, and great thirſt, the Lungs were found wonderfully dried; but this is refera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the eleventh head.</p>
                  <p>The other from <hi>Franciſeus Michinus,</hi> of one that ſuppoſedly died of an <hi>Empyema</hi> or Dropſy of the Breſt, the <hi>Pleura,</hi> and ſo the Lungs, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaſtinum,</hi> and partly the Spleen and Midriff, were thick and callous, or brawny ſteſhed.</p>
                  <p>Who would have imagined that Mr. <hi>Francis Edwards</hi> of <hi>Aleſy</hi> in this County, troubled long with an oppreſſing and ſtuffing at his Cheſt, eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by no Pectorals, ſhould have had an Animal like a Serpent bred there? he died at <hi>London,</hi> about the year 1661. and was opened, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians deſiring to ſee the cauſe of his ſtuffing and clogging that they could not help.</p>
                  <p>Nor are all theſe things we have writ, ſuch ſtrange and rare Caſes as ſome may imagine, but if men were opened, they would be thought the common cauſes of ſickneſſes, the wonderful variety of Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jo. Bilgerus</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Gregory Horſtius,</hi> intimates how a Maid that had a ſtuffing and ſhort breathing many years, at laſt that encreaſing, ſhe died, was opened; the Lungs found blackiſh, but no other fault in them, (this is referrable to ſtrengthen what we ſaid in the ninth Head) but when the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> according to its longitude, came to be cut up nigh the paſſages of the Lungs, through which Air is to be brought for fanning native heat, many black Caruncles like little knots or Peaſe, ſome bigger, ſome leſs, were found together, filling up the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Lungs; the Veins about the Heart and <hi>Diaphragma</hi> were full of Blood; ſhe had her Courſes ſtopped, and ſo that might add to the growth of theſe: ſo that theſe things do not commonly happen, not ſo as the Practical Phyſicians thought, but many times not in thoſe parts or places as they did imagine.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:93369:48"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pet. Paw.</hi> found, beſides one great Apoſtem in the Lungs, thirty little ones like knots, in his Anatomical Obſervations annexed to <hi>Thomas Bartholinus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XIII. Diſtinction of Cauſes is took from Conſumption or abſolute waſting away of the Lungs, as all other parts of the intern Body do; and truly there is ſcarce any thing we have writ of the Lungs, but is found in other parts; and what cauſes are found in other parts, <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis conſiderandis,</hi> may be found in the Lungs; and therefore we have been the larger to deſcribe all particulars.</p>
                  <p>A Gentlewomans Son, whom I knew at <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> was opened at <hi>London,</hi> dying of a Phthiſick, he had but a little bit of his Lungs left, his Liver huge large.</p>
                  <p>A Kinſman of mine in <hi>Holburn</hi> was Phthifical many years, and lived beyond expectation; he had fix or ſeven children, all died, but ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till four or five years of Age; one they opened, thinking it to have died of a Dropſy; but as I remember, the Mother told me it had ſcarce a pint of Water in its Belly, but the Lungs were waſted, and the Liver filled up the <hi>vacuum</hi> or yielding of the Lungs, it did ſo thruſt the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma,</hi> but it was very knotty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Columbus lib. 15. Anatomiae,</hi> Diffected one that had ſcarce any piece of his Lungs left; there was a great deal of difference twixt him and thoſe two, <hi>Sylvius</hi> and <hi>Puteus</hi> write of, that had five Lobes of the Lungs, when naturally men have but four.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Georgius Craſecchius</hi> in <hi>tract. de Pulmonum Vitiis,</hi> Diffected one that died of a Cough, and difficult breathing Phthifical; in the left capacity of the <hi>Thorax</hi> was much Water, purulent and faeculent, and ſome did affimilate to <hi>Pultis,</hi> and a very ſmall part of the Lungs left.</p>
                  <p>By theſe it is clear, man may live with a little piece of his Lungs; and he oftner dies of their ſtoppages or diverſity of corruption, then of their waſting, ten to one; and after this manner Nature acts in the reſt of the intern parts.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The Readers perhaps will expect we ſhould deliver ſomewhat of the Cure of all theſe Diſtempers, or of their particular Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Many of thoſe Aphoriſms concerning the cure of Head-Diſeaſes, are ſo general, they are to be conſulted in each of theſe.</p>
                  <p>If the cure of every Diſeaſe is by taking away the Cauſe, than we have given a good inſight into the Cure, by ſhewing all the Cauſes: But becauſe there is ſuch variety and alteration of Diſtempers, and their Cauſes, the wiſeſt Phyſician in moſt weighty buſineſſes, goes conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to work; and thence it is, every inferiour unlearned fellow, will cure the ſick <hi>Hab-Nab,</hi> and ſometimes when the Learned cannot do it; yea many an old Woman with a few odde Specificals, cures many buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that the Learned cannot accompliſh with a Courſe of Phyſick, not uſing thoſe Specificals.</p>

                  <p>II and III Heads were of Bones and Stones engendered in the Lungs. They are to be coughed up, the Apoſtmes in which lie, broken, if poſſibly they are to be diſſolved; Juyce of Chamomile, Goats Blood, and ſharp Vinegar diſſolve them; the Cough is to be appeaſed by mild, ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery emollient Medicines; though ſaccharate and ſweet things are uſed for the Lungs, they are apt to thicken and grow clammy, and turn to Flegm, and aggravate many Diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>IV. Worms. They are to be killed, and coughed forth, the Lungs are to be cleanſed; <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> is of chief uſe, and a pectoral Drink of Horehound, St. <hi>Johns</hi>-Wort, Hyſſop, Aniſeeds, and Graſs Roots, with Oyl of Vitriol and Brimſtone, or Vinegar of Squills, with Oyl of Sulphur.</p>
                  <p>V. Thoſe great or hard Bodies that from without are got into the Wind-pipe or Gullet, and ſo compreſs the Wind-pipe, muſt be cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, or vomited forth: or if they may go down into the Stomach, 'tis good to let them go: Oyl of Lillies, ſweet Almonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Fleſh and paſſages, are good to cauſe a ſlipery and eaſie coming forth.</p>
                  <p>VI. Concerning the Spongineſs of the Lungs, or their lightneſs, fuſſineſs and vacancy of Blood, there is ſcarce any Remedy; a Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral moiſtening and Analeptick Diet, is likely to do moſt.</p>
                  <p>VII and VIII. Wateriſhneſs of the Body and Lobes of the Lungs is found the Cauſe of many Griefs, and ſo the ſwiming of the Lungs in water, though perhaps they may be dry, as they are found divers times in a Dropſie of the Breſt, elſe we need not make ſuch diſtinction: That that dries the Body in other caſes, is good here, ſweating and provoking Urine: for the Kidneys ſhould attract or receive all the Water, the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93369:50"/> Guts, the Excrements and thick Food, the Liver and Gall, the Choler; and when and where any of theſe are the Cauſe, we muſt look to the part whoſe office it was to ſeparate and diſcharge theſe: we muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times look for centrary indications; for in a Dropſie of the Breſt, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing means are convenient; yet becauſe the Lungs therein may be dry, they do harm one way as they do good another: Some have handled the Cure of ſuch particular Dropſies, to whom I may refer you: Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurgery, if it be confirmed, is likelieſt to do moſt.</p>
                  <p>IX. In Diſcolorations of the Lungs alone is no need, nor no Eſſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Medicines, but that that gives the green colour, or yellow, or black, or white, or livid, of all which colour the Lungs have been found; and ſometimes not otherwayes ailing any thing: That that gives the Colour is ſpecifically to be purged forth, but this is not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen.</p>
                  <p>X. The ſticking, cleaving or growing of the Lungs to other parts, any that are nigh, ſpecially that participate in corrupting with them, is not alwayes diſcoverable, and as ſeldom curable; if we perceive they do adhere we cannot tell exactly to what part, in what kind, from what cauſe, and in what degree, little or much; hinderers of Putrifaction, ſpenders of moiſture, outward heaters and drawers forth of moiſture, are medicinal, as vomiting to looſen them, and purging to take away the antecedent cauſe, may be, and ſneezing, jumping, vociferati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. ſweet things, Lohocks, Syrups, ſpecially Gum Arabick, Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganth, Starch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are bad, glewing, and apt to be clungy; ſuch things are good to mix with Flegm, and to bring it up, and raiſe Coughing, whereby the Lungs are disburdened; alſo for ſtopping thin Rheum, and imbodying it, that it may be coughed up or raiſed; or to aſſwage Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Excoriation of the Wind-pipe or Lungs, elſe they often do hunt: and I am perſwaded the glutinous and flegmatick nature of the Lungs is encreaſed thereby. We may judge from outward things beſt, many times, how inward things be; and by things we ſee, thoſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come at to ſee; Sugars, Syrups, Lohochs, &amp;c. of that nature with heat, dry, and grow tough, and birdlimy and clungy, and ſo 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould act in the body, but the ſupply of moiſture keeps them from ſudden coagulation, or inſpiſſation.</p>
                  <p>XI. When the Lungs are dryed, void of blood, and light, there is ſcarce any help: for though we moiſten and nouriſh the body, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are not capable of drawing any nutriment to themſelves, or at leaſt not to convert it to a right uſe, the tone and office of them being ſo extinguiſhed: in ſuch caſes we muſt endeavour to make Life as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant as we may, and abate the Symptoms. It is a part of wiſdom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93369:50"/> thoſe things we cannot take away, to endeavour to mitigate them.</p>
                  <p>XII. The Lungs are found ſcirrhous, hard; ſometimes moiſt Scirrhs, and ſometimes light, dry Scirrhs, as Spunges; and ſometimes ſtony Scirrhs. To help this, ſoftning Oyntments, and Cataplaſms are ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if we can obſerve the Cauſe of this Cauſe; that is a main matter in the cure of all things, to ſee and obſerve all along what helped and harmed, and with what, and in what times the evil-ſeemed to encreaſe moſt; <hi>Lohoch</hi> and <hi>Eclegmas,</hi> and Pectoral Drinks are convenient; but the difference of Scirrhs asks for diverſity. Caruncles are to be cured otherwayes than Stones; and Spungineſs another way; and hardned Apoſtems another. A Lohoch made of the Syrup of Juyce of Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, <hi>Gum. Ammoniacum, Reſina Larirea,</hi> Liquoriſh, <hi>flos Sulphuris,</hi> and <hi>rad Althaeae</hi> is medicinal: Chamomile, Lilly roots, <hi>Althea,</hi> Lin-ſeed, Faenigreek-ſeed, Oyl of ſweet Almonds, <hi>Emplaſtrum Meliloti, Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum pro Splene,</hi> are outwardly helpful; <hi>A juvantibus &amp; nocentibus opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ſumitur indicatio;</hi> by ſuch things as help, and ſuch as hurt, we may find out the nature of the Diſtemper.</p>

                  <p>XIII. Waſting of the Lungs, are chiefly reſtored by Cauſes contrary to thoſe that did cauſe waſting, for they differ in differing people; commonly this is called a Conſumption, though there be divers kinds: and in ſome Conſumptions the Lungs are firm; yet where the Lungs are waſted, ſeldom but there is a Conſumption, ſo that we may make this diſtinction: Every waſting away of the Lungs is a Conſumption, but every Conſumption or waſting away of Fat and Fleſh, is not a waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lungs, or proceeded therefrom. The fooliſh Vulgar call all that lie long fick, and waſte, Conſumptives, and ſo indeed they be; for Conſumption doth only ſignifie a waſting or conſuming; and ſo in all diſeaſes, they that lie long ſick and cannot eat their food, for the moſt part waſte, and yet the Lungs ſafe; nor are an <hi>Atrophia, Phthiſis</hi> and Hectick Feaver all the waſting and kinds thereof that do happen; nor doth all waſting waſte after one or other of theſe kinds.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Do not intend by Dropſies onely to give the inſight of that Diſtemper to my Readers, but to ſhew the Courſe and Order of Nature in change of all the Bowels: In theſe things under this Title may be ſeen the variety of all Diſtempers, and in what little Order and Method any Diſtempers run. If the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well conſiders all the Hiſtories, and the Reaſons wherefore we writ them, he will ſee apparently how the inward Bowels are or may be affected in ſickneſs, how one ſuffers with or by another; how, in one ſick perſon, one bowel is thus affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, another ſo: For we ſee Medicines that are one and the ſame, in divers Bodies have divers Operations; ſo the ſame humours alike qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litied, in two bowels produce divers effects; one bowel by the ſame matter is turned ſcirrhous, another is reſolved into purulency: both the peculiarity of the quality of the Humour, and the apt diſpoſition of the paſſive Cauſe, is the cauſe which we cannot foreſee; and when we do ſee it, give no reaſon thereof: This may juſtly reprove thoſe that ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily think to ſum up all the Ways and Works of GOD in one Rule, or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93369:53"/> general Term; <hi>His ways are paſt finding out</hi> by the wiſe, much more by the ſuperſtitiouſly addicted, and ſuch as build to their own Reaſon without the Foundation of Experience; that which he hath ordained at the food for our capable, docile, and tractable Souls, to encreaſe in knowledge by, and grow up in true knowledge. The <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> did admire how any one could ſignifie his mind to another in a piece of Paper, and thought it ſupernatural, and done by Spirits: even ſo do all of us admire thoſe things we have no experience of, which are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs in the courſe of Nature, and in GOD's Ordination; and the reaſon why men ſtill admire at them, is, becauſe they will not ſearch for Truth, and take pains to ſee the Ordination of God, and to find but the true and ſincere Method, and Courſe, and Variety of Nature: Men may write Books of <hi>Romances,</hi> and Imaginary Conceptions of their own Brain, eaſily and readily, <hi>feſtinanti calamo;</hi> and ſo ſlight the obſervance of the Works of GOD, and prefer a few Jingles and high-derived Words and Philoſophical Rules of Mens making, when the Courſe of Nature is GOD's, and of greater Dignity: for I can make true Rules of Nature than others, and if ſo, better; and if ſo, who ſhould I boaſt or glory with theirs? I value not what any Man hath writ, for I am a Man as well as he; and to him that thinks ſo, my Writing is of as great Authority: But let the Courſe of Nature, the Work of a GOD be Judge betwixt Us; let the <hi>Autopſia</hi> of the thing ſhew which gueſſed the trueſt of it, unſeen: Let no mans Opinion (if it be onely the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Man) be much built upon, eſpecially if its grounds be no more then its ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> Opinion.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall firſt ſhew the ſignification of the word <hi>Dropſie,</hi> its riſe, and what is its common acceptation, which may differ from the ſincere meaning of the Original Word; and then ſhew the divers kindes that according to vulgar acceptation, or common meaning of the word, may be, or are called the Dropſie: And herein many, many times, diſpute about they know not what; one meaning one thing by the word, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther another.</p>
                  <p>The Dropſie or Hydropſie in Engliſh, comes from <hi>Hydrops</hi> in Latin, and that is only a change of the Greek letters into Latine, thoſe tongues being writ in differing letters: Well then, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Aſcites,</hi> the word for common Dropſies, comes from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:93369:53"/> word ſignifying a Baſon, Laver, or Pitcher, becauſe their Bellies refer to the Bellies of Pitchers, or Water-Veſſels; ſo that from the faſhion of the tumid Belly, it is proper to call them <hi>Aſciticks,</hi> though Water is not the Cauſe, but as the word is commonly taken, improper.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Tympanites</hi> in Latine, and Tympany in Engliſh, according to the common meaning, ſhews a windy Dropſie; but the ſence of the word ſhews a Drum; or that the Belly ſtrutting forth and ſounding like a Drum, may in any perſon be called a <hi>Tympany,</hi> though it may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wind; yet water without ſome wind will ſcarce yeild a noiſe: It comes from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that ſignifies a Drum.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third kind, or name of diſtinction uſed by the Ancients, was <hi>Anaſarcha,</hi> or <hi>Leucophlegmatia,</hi> they commonly meant by the uſe of thoſe words a puffing up of the Body and Face from Flegm, the Skin looſe, Face bluffed and pale; if we go to the meaning of the word in the Original Derivation <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>per carnem,</hi> it ſignifies ſome humour or matter ſpread throughout the Fleſh, or imbibed therein, or throughout.</p>
                  <p>But people have been deceived in theſe, for Nature imitates no ſuch Order or Rule, there is no neceſſity for a Dropſie, if it be not according to the deſcription of <hi>Aſcites,</hi> to be <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> nor if it be not <hi>Anaſarca</hi> muſt it be <hi>Tympanites:</hi> To ſee a party juſt as <hi>Galen</hi> deſcribed, is as rare as thoſe they count ſtrange Caſes. We ſhall let the Reader ſee the Truth, as far as man hitherto can find a method in Nature, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in theſe caſes is to want a method; ſpecially as to peculiar and ſmall things: the quality in every matter, if we could ſee it, or know it, would give us the trueſt inſight how it muſt work, and what it muſt effect.</p>
                  <p>The matter, ſaid the Ancients, is either Water, Wind, or Flegm; the Bowel or Subject was the Liver; the Cauſe was cold, and theſe onely: the precedent or procatarctick cauſes, were too great evacution of Blood, or ſuppreſſion of Courſes or Haemorrhoids, a Jaundice, Cochexy, or drinking of Water; theſe were the principal, with the diſtinctions aforenamed, that the Ancients delivered; the Signs and Concomitant Symptoms they delivered are not worth naming: for thoſe that they wrote aright in, are common; others are nothing of Rule, but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, ſo that they might have numbered a thouſand Symptoms or Ails that many Hydropicks, one or other amongſt them had had.</p>
                  <p>The Moderns, as <hi>Sennertus, Hercules Saxonia, Riverius, Platerus,</hi> &amp;c. did introduce diverſe new things from experience, and found that heat as well as cold, was the Cauſe, and that ſometimes cool things that open, do good; alſo they ſaw that the Kidneys and Spleen, as well as the Liver, might cauſe the Dropſie.</p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:93369:54"/>
                  <p>We ſhall not ſtand to deſcribe or tranſcribe the Cauſes, Signs, Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks and Cures differing in <hi>Aſcites, Tympanites,</hi> and <hi>Anaſarca,</hi> that the Moderns have laid down, they may be read fully in their Practices, and compared with what follows; they are defective, and rarely found as they have deſcribed, yet are in ſome or other, at one time or other, in ſome meaſure or other true: as for example; <hi>Jo. Johnstonus, Idea Med. Pract. cap. de Tympanite,</hi> ſaith, <hi>In a Tympany the Skin is ſtretched out and gliſters, it looks like a Drum Cover, and ſtruck, gives ſuch a ſounding; it thruſts out the Navil very much outwardly, the Belly is puffed up, but no ſenſe of great weight; cruſhed, the finger leaves no impreſſion, but the Skin preſently riſes up again; belchings and breaking wind downwards are often and rumbling in the Belly: the cauſe is weak heat, or terrifying great heat, which reſolves the matter into Vapours;</hi> (which the Antients acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not.) The place is not in the Stomach, for there the wind would be belched forth; nor in the Guts, for then <hi>per anum</hi> it would be caſt forth; but a Tympany is generated commonly betwixt the Coats of the Meſentery and Inteſtines; for in a Tympany are pains about the Navil, and pains of the Loins, and gripings of the Meſentery tied to theſe parts, being diſtended by wind.</p>
                  <p>Cure is by bringing forth the wind, a Carminative Wine, a great Cuppinglaſs applied, Frictions, Foments, diſcuſſing wind, inwardly ſuch as warm and correct the diſtemper of the Bowel cauſing the wind.</p>
                  <p>Now one in a Tympany may have ſome wind, and moſt water; for they are ſeldom abſolutely ſeparate, then it may be called both: Many Hydropicks are puffed up, and windy; if it be nothing but wind, the ſick may have one of theſe ſignes and not another, but other not here mentioned; if he have all thoſe ſigns, he may not have a like inward Cauſe; if the inward Cauſe in two be exactly alike, yet the outward or fomenting antecedent Cauſes might be quite contrary, that ſtirred up inward Cauſes alike; if the inward Cauſes be viſibly exactly alike, yet they may have different effects or events, for death may enſue to one, life to the other: and thus doth Nature vary, whoſe Method in thoſe things Phyſicians wrote a Method of, is to want a Method or Rule.</p>
                  <p>We will now from our own Obſervations, bringing the Witneſſes of many Authors, <hi>fide digniſſimi,</hi> to atteſt what we write by their impartial unintereſted and non-ſuperſtitious Experience, ſhew the Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and more particularly the ſwellings of the Body from wind or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, introducing a multitude of other things: So that this particular Tractate may be uſeful as a general Practice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We have obſerved divers Maids and Women, in ſtopt Menſtrues, to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93369:54"/> have their Bellies ſwell, and Feet, gradually, on Nights firſt, and then ſo largely, that they were ſwelled on days too, largely; as full as Skin could almoſt hold, pitting, or leaving the dint of the finger cruſhing them, in them, along while ere they roſe up again to equal heighth with the reſt of the fleſh; the ſureſt token that water was the ſwelling matter: I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved theſe Hydropick ſwellings of the feet commonly to come with pain, redneſs, and then itching; the Attoms of the Blood that did at firſt flow, exhaling, the ſwelling turned paler, leſs hot and painful, and clearly wateriſh, and ſo it is in moſt outward Tumours, and this is a chief Univerſal Method in Nature; yet no General Rule is without Exceptions: for I have had both my hands ſwelled up like Bladders, and from Cold, without any foregoing Flux of Blood; if I laid my hand againſt the Mantle-piece, and my forehead upon the back of my hand, in a little time it had ſo cruſhed the water away on either ſide, that I could have ſeated an Egg on the back of my hand, in the preſure of my forehead, very faſt; and this huge pit or hollow would by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees riſe up again to its former heighth and equality with the other Skin; I found that none of my inward parts were the cauſe of this; I always drank very little: ſo I have known ſome had their Legs hydropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, ſtanding in cold water, others with a ſore, or pain in their Legs, others after Agues, the Belly alſo ſwelling, but no harm to the inward Bowels was in <hi>fieri.</hi> What ſhall we ſay? Maids or Women that want their Courſes, their Bellies ſwell, and Feet: is it an <hi>Aſcites,</hi> becauſe in the Feet apparently is water? is it a <hi>Tympany,</hi> becauſe in the Belly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently is wind, or retained blood, and wind, and Ichor in the <hi>Uterus?</hi> is it a Dropſie at all, becauſe none of the Bowels, no not the Liver, is cooled or hurt in ſome? it goes away naturally: ſometimes if their Courſes come not down, ſome are held a long time, and know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are with Child, or in a Dropſie; for ſometimes the Symptoms of a Dropſie in one, prove the Symptoms of Gravidity in another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plater</hi> in <hi>Obſerv. Extuberantiae,</hi> about <hi>page</hi> 659, and 660, relates of three particular Women that thought themſelves (being ſwelled) big with Child, and the ſwelling did ceaſe in all naturally, as it aroſe; but a 4th woman being ſo ſwelled, and in ſuſpicion of being with Child, died.</p>
                  <p>In another woman in ſuppreſſion of Courſes be obſerved the Belly ſwelled up, yet no Dropſie; ſhe was reſtored by Remedies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another kind of Dropſies we may call an <hi>Inflation;</hi> I have both ſeen it, and been informed of the like in others: theſe were ſuddenly in two or three days ſwelled up, the Eyes almoſt cloſed in, the face ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly puffed, the Belly turgid, Legs and Hands ſwelled, a good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, Strength and Reaſon remaining; yet in theſe two or three I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93369:55"/> what I write from, there was difference, ſo that in each diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we muſt make diſtinction, if we would have clear and ſincere Truth, and punctually decide Controverſies; one was helped by Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane-Water, or rather on Natures accord; the other by good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and Anti-hydropicals; others are totally and ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated, different from theſe, and in one thing or other from each other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Platerus, Obſ. Extuberantia, pag.</hi> 632. relates of a Maid ſwelled all over, Face, Feet, Belly, and elſewhere, a difficult breathing; and in a few days recovered as quickly, as ſhe quickly fell ſo: Nor can theſe be imputed to Poyſons. As I remember <hi>Nicolaus Tulpius</hi> hath an Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation like theſe, of a total ſwelling of the Body like a Dropſie, that aroſe in a few days, and ceaſed again ſpontaneouſly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third kind we have obſerved in two, but not found the like in Authors; They were looſe skinned, and full of water outwardly, the Feet did a little ſwell, but no ſymptom of illneſs was therein; they had many water-bliſters on their Fleſh, ſpecially their Paps or Teats did run much, their skin was very ſubject to break into bliſters of pare water, void of Accrimony, except ſometime a little itching; nor were the inward parts by any outward ſigns at all in fault, though in divers ſymptoms they did ſomewhat vary, yet both had one Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Drinking Strong Beer or Ale conſtantly on mornings Firſt of all, which they were not uſed to: &amp; I have heard a third perſon ſay, that if he drank Ale on mornings faſting, it made his Blood wateriſh; but though the outward Cauſe is ſurely one and the ſame, yet the variety of Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is ſtupendious: If in theſe the redundant water of the blood was excluded as unneceſſary for Natures uſe, and heterogenious to the blood, to the outward parts, or Cutaneous Superfice, and there did gather in bladders, and thoſe broke, poured forth <hi>Serum,</hi> and then filled again; why may not Nature, being overburdened by water, in the blood that offendeth, either in quality or quantity, or both, caſt off this <hi>Serum</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inward Bowels, and there raiſe bladders, and thoſe break and pour out the <hi>Serum</hi> into the capacity of the <hi>Abdomon,</hi> and then fill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? for we know nothing will endure a ſuperabundance; and more <hi>Serum</hi> ſtill ouſing and preſſing into theſe bladders, breaks them, and they fall down flat, and by degrees gather more <hi>Serum,</hi> and are diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; indeed there is rarely any Botch, <hi>Struma, Glandula, Callus,</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, Tumour, Ulcer, Gangrene, <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> Cancer, <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> Diſcolora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tubercles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that happen to the outward parts, but they happen to the inward Bowels, as Liver, Spleen, Heart, Reins, Meſentery, Lungs, <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A Boy ten years old had a twiſting of his Guts and ſtoppage of Excrements; they came up by his mouth: he was hugely ſwelled, his Belly diſtended with wind, according to the Practicks deſcription of a Tympany: he lived thus fourteen dayes; then dying, he was opened; the Guts were found twiſted up together, and in ſome of them Worms with dung in great number came forth: in other Guts was abundance of wind, exceedingly diſtending them, and breaking forth with great violence as ſoon as they were cut; no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was found in him. I do not ſee it ſo proper to call this a Tympany, as an Illiack paſſion; and if it had been joyned with water, it had not ſo properly been called a Tympany neither, ſo that with Water (Wind commonly being made through Rarefaction of Water by heat into Air) it might be called a Water-Dropſie with Inflation, without Water an Inflation, Illiack or Cholical diſtemper: Indeed where there is much Water, commonly is ſome Flegm; and where both theſe be, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is windineſs, becauſe they are made of a moiſt, cold, raw, and ſpiritleſs diſpoſition of the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Bowels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhall diſcover no more kinds of Dropſies in this Order, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Concommitant Symptomes we ſhall enumerate, much more variety may appear; but to go curiouſly to diſcriminate of each of thoſe ſeven. Heads, we may make as many ſolid Diviſions in each, ſpecially in the fifth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt and chief Symptom that troubles Hydropicks is an <hi>Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> or difficult breathing, that is moſt general. <hi>Plater.</hi> pag. 638. A Woman with Child had a Dropſie; breathing was ſo difficult, ſhe was often nigh ſuffocated; ſhe bringeth forth, and having good natural purgations, is delivered of her Dropſie. And <hi>Obſ. pag.</hi> 64. A Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man drew his breath with exceeding ſtraitneſs in a Dropſie, he uſed to drink hot and ſtrong Liquors; he died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Skenk. pag.</hi> 417. One Aſcitick, was not commonly ſo ſtrait-breathed, but when he went to eat or drink or to ſleep, he was almoſt choaked. <hi>River. Cent. 2. Obſ.</hi> 67. mentions an Aſthma in a Dropſie, as an high trouble to the Hydropick party he mentions; And</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nic. Tulp. lib. 2. obſ.</hi> 34. mentions one that for divers years was very
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93369:57"/> hard breathed, died hydropical; opened, there was a ſwelling of the Meſentery weighing twenty pound, that was three years increaſing, and cruſhed up the parts, for the Lungs and Breſt, and all other parts were ſound; and <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 39. an <hi>Aſthma</hi> in an Hydropick was exceeding great, water ran out dayly <hi>per ſcrotum,</hi> but gave no eaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jo. Bilgerus, Epiſt. ad Gregor. Horſtium,</hi> mentions a Dropſie of the Breſt, four years encreaſing, with hard breathing, which grew ſtrong and great; opened, the Lungs outwardly were ſpotted, inwardly putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plater. Obſ. Extuberantiae, pag.</hi> 646. In one (that he opened) he found the Kidneys exulcerated and perforated, and no other matters of corruption to or in other parts conſiderable, yet the cruſhing up of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and Lungs, by the redundancie of water, cauſed a great <hi>Dyſpnaea;</hi> the party afore Death had let out much water by bliſters, made in the lower parts, and the Belly did aſſwage and ſink therefrom, and the <hi>Dyſpnaea</hi> abated, ſo that the quantity of water cruſhing up the parts of reſpiration, was apparently the Cauſe; and the ſoaking of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Lungs, <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and Muſcles of the Breſt, doth in ſome occaſion hard breathing,; but the party aforenamed, the water being leſſened, and ſeemingly ſhe in a better condition, died with faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond Symptom or Concomitant Affect in Dropſies, is Wind, which in ſome is more, in ſome leſs; in ſome it more afflicts at one time, in others at another; in ſome in one part, in others in another; and many of the many and different ſymptoms and ails that afflict Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropicks, ariſe partly from Wind and Flegm as well as Water.</p>
                  <p>A Dropſie firſt began with inflation, the Belly was Tympanitical, then the feet began to ſwell with Water, and other ſigns of a Water-Dropſie aroſe, cured, <hi>River. Cent. 3. Obſ.</hi> 86.</p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>Felix Platerus</hi> in <hi>Obſervationibus,</hi> in an <hi>Aſcites,</hi> or Water-Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſaw abundance of wind, or a Tympany therewith.</p>
                  <p>In a Lady I knew that was Hydropical, after letting Blood, wind did ſo increaſe that ſhe died Tympanitical; the taking away Blood in ſuch cold Diſtempers, which all are not cold, weakens Nature, and adds to the Morbifick Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe ſwellings that come ſuddenly all over, or in the Belly either, though the ſwelling dints like water, yet there is much wind therein. See <hi>Tulp. Obſ. Med. lib.</hi> 2. and <hi>Plat. pag.</hi> 632. two ſuch were cured: All things have their variety, and divers kindes, and every kind its <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and every <hi>ſpecies</hi> variety and degrees; two Extreams, and one <hi>Medium:</hi> the greateſt wiſdom is to diſtinguiſh between likes; that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93369:57"/> might put an end to many Controverſies; and to know Natures variety might end many Diſputes; and when one ſaith a thing is thus, another ſaith, Nay, but it is ſo, and both theſe may be true; for in one it may be ſo, in another thus; one ſaith this is the Cauſe of a Dropſie, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that, and both may be in the right; for both theſe are in ſome the Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes there is much wind without any water, as in our ſeventh Head or Diſtinction of Kinds, and ſometimes there is much water without any wind or flatuoſity; ſometimes they are equally quantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and ſometimes in an Inflation is a little water, and in an <hi>Aſcites</hi> a little wind; and ſo for Flegm, which is onely thickned water, or glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated moiſture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Symptom or Ail in Dropſies is Flegm, or a clogging up, ſtoppage, or Obſtructions therefrom. The Ancients made three Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, the Water-Dropſie, or <hi>Aſcit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, Flegm, put together, it ſignifieth white Fleam, or Flegm; ſo that if the Ancients had took <hi>Leucophlegmatia</hi> for the Cauſe, and <hi>Anaſarcha</hi> for the Effect, theſe two together might myſtically have ſhewn a Diſeaſe: We muſt ſay of this, as of wind, ſometimes there is much water or wind without any flegm, and ſometimes much flegm without any water or wind; ſometimes a little flegm, a little wind, and much water, are complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in one Body; ſometimes a Tympany and <hi>Leucophlegmatia</hi> ſeem moſt to exſuperate, ſometimes an <hi>Aſcites</hi> and Tympany, ſometimes an <hi>Aſcites</hi> and <hi>Leucophlegmatia,</hi> and ſometimes they are ſeparate and diſtinct: but then I think it not ſo proper to call white flegm and wind a Dropſie, without any water, though they diſtend the skin in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

Obſ. 31. &amp; Obſ.</hi> 29. He obſerved little Urine made in one to the proportion he drank, to effect moſt apparently a Tympany, or rather a windy than wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh.</p>
                  <p>Swelling of the Body, difficult breathing, wearineſs, purſineſs, dulneſs, bad colour, vitiated ſanguification, puffing up, loſs of appetite, Cachexyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ariſe as much from flegm as water in many Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks; yet in thoſe that are opened, no flegm is conſpicuous, but the parts are often clammy, and grown together, and have viſcous corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in them, and Glandules, and Apoſtems: We know in outward things (for by them it is beſt judging of inward, and by apparent and viſible things, things occult and inviſible) the thin parts exhaling, the Remains are made thicker, ſpecially in ſaccharates and gummy things, which have moſt ſyngeny and coherence with flegm.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe that which ſome call a <hi>Leucophlegmatia,</hi> others call a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chexia,</hi> for indeed there is no difference but of degrees; for what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful variety is there in Nature? and thoſe are miſtaken that think Nature is bound to make it a <hi>Leucophlegmatia,</hi> as they deſcribe it, if it is not a <hi>Cachexia</hi> as they deſcribe it; for to find a <hi>Leucophlegmatia</hi> juſt as they deſcribe, or a <hi>Cachexia</hi> juſt ſo, is rare: Many diſtempers are like either in ſome ſymptoms, and like neither in ſome.</p>

                  <p>A Dropſie of the Breſt was four years encreaſing, all that while ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windedneſs did afflict, and daily encreaſed: dying, the Lungs were found ſpotted outwardly, and being cut, did inwardly appear putrified, <hi>Johannes Bilgerus, Epiſt. Med.</hi>

                  <p>We commonly have obſerved Dropſies, as they differ in all other things, ſo in the Acuteneſs and Cronicalneſs; ſome die in a quarter of a year, ſome in half a year; ſome at the years end, and ſome not till two years: and ſo ſome recover in a quarter, ſome in half, ſome in a whole year; and ſome recover after two years Hydropicalneſs, but this not very frequent: they are beſt and eaſilieſt cured at firſt.

                  <p>Divers in Dropſies finde one thing that cures them or leſſens their evil, and then through uncarefulneſs, or Aſtral Ordination, they fall back and die; and ſometimes are cured upon a relaps, but not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly: that Medicine that gave help or eaſe at firſt, upon a relaps for the moſt part will avail little.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we ſhall ſhew ſomewhat of Prognoſtick Signs: Though nothing is more uncertain; many things may be gathered from what Obſervations preceded: for we ſet down at the end of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Symptoms, ſuch an one died, or recovered, or was cured, to avoid the trouble of writing all thoſe Obſervations over again here, for the Prognoſtick Signs therein: for unleſs in many the whole Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſhewn, it cannot well be judged how deſperate or hopeful the Party might be by one Symptom alone rehearſed; but when he ſees all the Symptoms, and the Cauſe by diſſection manifeſted, he might judge truly of Life or Death in another, the acuteneſs or ſlowneſs of the Diſeaſe in another ſo handled, did two exactly accord, or have the event exactly alike. It is the part of a wiſe man to ſuſpend judgement,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93369:61"/> eſpecially raſhly in the moſt clear caſes, for we are never able to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the effects and divers operations of Nature; <hi>We muſt endeavour all things, but the work is of God, as Scaliger</hi> well ſaith, <hi>Sanitas opus eſt Dei, opera vero noſtra.</hi>

                  <p>Thoſe whoſe Urine or Excrements are altogether ſuppreſt, and yet they eat and drink; we may the moſt certainly predict their death in a ſhorter or longer time, if they do not go to Stool, or make Water, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Nature takes care to void it by the Navil or other places, which is rare; but what is this <hi>Prognoſis</hi> to a Phyſician? cannot every Ruſtick ſay and ſee ſo much?</p>

                  <p>So for Gangraened Exulcerations of the Legs, Thighs or Navil, any would predict Death, if they ſhould continue rotting, the Water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue running, and the Belly continue ſwelling; but who can tell whether theſe will continue encreaſing, or if they do, when or how they will kill?</p>

                  <p>Nor is <hi>Paracenteſis</hi> in Dropſies commonly lucky: for when all the water, is drawn out on heaps, ſometimes they die preſently, even as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes Ludovicus,</hi> ſixty years old, the water drawn forth, died in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts hands, <hi>Mich.

                  <p>Relapſes for the moſt part are mortal, but not always; one will ſay this is the Cauſe, another that; but if we could ſee the inward Bowels, many times we could not tell the cauſe, or how they might change, live, or die.</p>
                  <p>Many that have had many, and the worſt of Symptoms, have lived; and thoſe that ſeemingly have not been dangerous, have died: and in Diſſections it is abundantly cleared, that ſome live till all their parts are rotted or waſted, or corrupted; ſome till two or three are waſted, rotted, or corrupted; and ſome die when ſcarce any Cauſe can be found worthy of ſeparating the Soul from its Caſe the Body: But the quality and heterogeneity of all matter to our Blood and Spirits, and that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that conſtitutes our vitality, is the chief Cauſe, which we can hardly ſee into.</p>

                     <p>It is certain that the Antients delivered little or nothing of Truth, concerning the inward cauſes of Dropſies, nor can the Reader under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one thing in twenty, rightly as he ſhould, by their Practices, even in moſt Diſeaſes; ſpecially concerning the inward cauſes of the Diſeaſe: nor did they underſtand Natures variety, nor Vermifick, Lapidifick, Crinifick, Oſſifick, Fermentative Putrefactive, and Preſervative Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, or Qualities.</p>
                     <p>We will firſt ſhew the quantity of water that lifts up the Bellies of ſome, and is the cauſe of their ſwelling.</p>

                     <p>A Kinſmans Childe of mine, died, they thought of a Dropſie, it was ſwelled, and like water: opened, not above one Pint of water was found in it: the Liver was huge large and knotted, but the Lungs waſted, the Liver made the Belly ſeem ſo big. Familiarly in diverſe that were opened where the Lungs are waſted, the Liver growes out to poſſeſſe the room they have left; my Kinſman had ſix or ſeven Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all died; he was <hi>Tabid</hi> and Conſumptive himſelf, and ſo his <hi>Semen</hi> contaminated: they none of them lived to above five or ſix yeers of age as I remember: they opened onely one.</p>

                     <p>Next we ſhall come to declare the faults of the Spleen in Dropſies: The Spleen as well as the Liver, Kidneys, and other parts, is found juſt ſo, or otherwiſe affected, more grievouſly than in the Dropſie, and yet no Dropſie, but other evils ariſe therefrom; therefore it is hard to ſay what Bowel cauſes a Dropſie, or what particular affect of that Bowel doth it; ſince when it is ſo affected in others, other diſtempers ariſe therefrom: the qualities in all matter, as we have ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in our Book of qualities, in our <hi>Phyſiology, Jatroſophy</hi> and <hi>Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matography,</hi> give the motion and alteration to all Bodies, ſpecially as they are influenced upon by the Air, altered by the qualities of the Stars.</p>

                     <p>But the Heart and Lungs ſurely deſerve to be ſpoken of ere theſe; but becauſe they are in an upper Ventricle, and ſeparated by a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane from the Bowels that lie moſt in the water, we omitted them till now.</p>
                     <p>Some now adayes think the heart muſt be the Cauſe of Dropſies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the chief Inſtrument of Sanguification; but their prepoſſeſſed Conceptions muſt vail to Experience; We ſhould think nothing to be
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93369:69"/> ſo, till we find it by Experience: Of all the Bowels, the Heart is the leaſt corrupted in Dropſies.</p>

                        <hi>Plater.</hi> did indeed finde it looſe and flaccid in one or two, and a bone in it, in one Hydropick. But very little alteration is in the Heart, as in the other inferiour Bowels, therefore that cauſes and ſuffers the leaſt.</p>
                     <p>Of the Lungs in general Dropſies, theſe things are obſerved:</p>
                     <p>In a Dropſie with a Phthſick, the Lungs were rather drie then moiſt; the right Lung grew to the ſide, <hi>Tho. Barth. Cent. 2. Obſ.</hi> 37.</p>

                        <hi>Platerus, pag.</hi> 647. found the Lungs, in a general Dropſie, inequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coloured, and in part vitiated; water was in the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and yet Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Spleen ſound.</p>
                     <p>In a pure Tympany with a Convolvulus, <hi>Platerus</hi> found the Lungs corrupted, and grown to the Side, the Liver had ſtones in it, and the Spleen was waſted.</p>
                     <p>We will now ſhew a few Examples of the Method of Nature in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Bladders, Bliſters or Veſicles to hold water where the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> of any Bowel is peſtered therewith, either through moiſt aliament, or ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the right paſſage of that water by the Kidneys, and ſo regurgitating upon this part or that; or elſe the blood is wateriſh, and throws it off there; or elſe the part is apoſtemated, and the blood turns to water; in this Caſe, Nature ordains bladders to grow, to contain the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moiſture in theſe Bowels: and becauſe it is ſo frequent and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, as we have ſhewn already by many Examples, we may look upon it as the Rule, or a Method in Nature; yet as often exſuperating water gets no bladders to hold it in. Yet if the Antients had wrote of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-bladders in the Body of Man, their Cauſes, Signes, Differences, Prognoſticks and Cures, they had done ſomewhat of reality and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and might have exhibited one of Natures Rules, giving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal large exception, and diverſities.</p>

                     <p>The Cure of a Dropſie is as various as the Signs and Cauſes; for one is curable, another not; and he that is curable, differs from another in the way of method he muſt be cured in, as well as particular Medicines.</p>
                     <p>I. We ſhall ſay ſomewhat of the chief and moſt ſucceſsful quality in Medicines, and that is, a Diuretick force: Diureticks, as we have well obſerved, are moſt generally helpful; and thoſe Purgers that, withall, do move Urine; for it is contrary to Nature to expel redundant <hi>Serum</hi> by the Guts, the faculty of the Kidneys, Emulgents and Ureters muſt be excited; purging oft weakens Nature, not carryes forth the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: but nothing is ſo bad, that helps not ſome; nor any thing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, that will cure all: and I have known in divers Hydropicks, as well as other Sickneſſes, one ſimple vulgar Medicine hath done more then Methods of Bleeding, Sweating, Purging, Vomiting, and Opening.</p>
                     <p>Juyce of our Flow-de-luce-Roots helped one in two or three dayes, not helped by other Medicines; the Lee of Broome Aſhes, another; Horſradiſh, one <hi>Ruſtick</hi> did boaſt, would cure all; and another Woman helped divers with common <hi>Sambacus;</hi> Another I know, uſes Broom Beer: almoſt ſo many Hydropical perſons, ſo many Medicines; but they try oftentimes divers Medicines, ere they light on that they think cures; but the inward diſpoſition of the body, and lucky time, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Stars, when that Medicine was given, is to be conſidered.</p>

                     <p>It was related to me, that a Gentlemans man being much ſwelled, was told that <hi>Guaiacum</hi> was excellent for a Dropſie; he therefore took one of his Maſters Bowls, and either boyled or powdered it, and was cured by it; his Maſter afterward miſſing his Bowl, it was ingenuouſly confeſſed, That his Man had took it for his Dropſie; the Maſter ſeeing his Man cured, and as they atteſted, by that, forgave him.

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:93369:82"/> is the cauſe of a Diſeaſe. I have not picked Obſervations for me, or left out thoſe againſt me; for indeed I do not ſet my ſelf to be for one or other, and then bring Experiences that make for me to prove it; but impartially, leaning neither to one, or other, I ſearch Experience, and to the Truth Lapply, and ſubject my Opinions thereto. Yet here will come in ſome things conſiderable, beſides what hath gone before, different from what Practical Authors have writ, or over and above what they writ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the Subject or Part, Head-ach varies; the Antients onely diſtinguiſhed a <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. So for matter of <hi>Genera,</hi> or kinds of Head-aches; the Antients did not know all, and thoſe they wrote for, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Courſe and Method of Nature are as ſeldom found in, as thoſe things they count Rarityes; in all Diſeaſes, as Epilepſies, Apoplexies, Lethargyes, Madneſs, Phrenſy, <hi>Delirium,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, Palſies, <hi>Stupor,</hi> &amp;c. may be pain of the Head, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as a wateriſh Flegm, or green, or yellow, or black water, or gelly, or purulency, or Apoſtematous matter is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in this part or that of the Head, more or leſſe for quantity, more homogenious or heterogenious in quality.</p>
                  <p>Some have a pain of the Head alwayes at Sun riſe, and as the Sun draws <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>igher, the more vehement; and after Noon, that the Sun goes farther off, the pain fades.</p>
                  <p>Others have a pain onely at Noon, a dayes.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:93369:82"/>
                  <p>Others have pain in the Head, according to the courſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sometimes pains of the Head are Epidemical, ſometimes they are continual, ſometimes they come by certain Periods, and Paroxyſmes, as Agues; ſometimes a <hi>Diſpoſitio patibilis, Capitis,</hi> as <hi>Platerus,</hi> in <hi>Praxi Medica,</hi> obſerves, is the Cauſe every light motion, imagination, fretting, heat of the fire, lying awaken, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> raiſeth Head-ach.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the pain is a ſhooting and dogging, ſometimes an heavineſs and dullneſs, ſometimes like pulling and dilacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſometimes a ſence of violent diſtenſion, and burdening; and there are more Varieties ſtill.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor are the Cauſes the ſame, and no more than what Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Authors write.</p>
                  <p>Stones of divers forms and magnitudes are found the cauſe of many ſharp and Cronical Head-pains; theſe Stones lye ſometime in one part of the Head ſometimes another; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ſneezed forth, and Head-ach hath ceaſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from; ſometimes they have killed, and been found by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection.</p>
                  <p>Worms alſo of divers ſhapes and magnitudes are generated in the Brain, or parts of the Head, even as they and Stones are generated in all parts of the Body beſides; they cauſe great itching in ſome, pain and dogging in the Heads of others.</p>
                  <p>Sometime Critical, ſometimes Cronical, ſometimes they creep forth, or are ſneezed out; ſometimes they kill, and are found by <hi>Anatomy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Epidemical Head-aches have been found from a Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of the Air, turning the Humours in the Head into Worms, even as the Air diſpoſeth Children to verminous affects in Guts or Stomach.</p>
                  <p>In others that are diſſected, there are found bladders of water, or Apoſtemes of a ſharp matter, or Inky matter, or yellow wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                  <p>An Acquaiutance of mine, a prudent Phyſitian, told me that two or three years ſince, a Child was opened nigh <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> I think by Doctor <hi>Wright,</hi> it had long been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Head-pains, and grievous; in the forepart, there was found a Bladder of water lying in the forehead, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the eyes.</p>

                        <hi>Dyet.</hi> 1. Where the Air is moiſt. 2. Dyet moiſtening and yielding good nutritive Juice, are to be chiefly prepared; Cock's Stones, or the Broath of a Pullet, Cock or Capon, or other Yelk of Eggs, Pheaſants, Patridges and the like, which nouriſh much, are very proper Dyet. Salt Meats are not alowable.</p>
                     <p>For Drink may be made Emulſions of the four great cold Seeds, with Barly-water, and ſweetened with Syrups of Violets; if Wine may be permitted, it muſt be thin, and well allayed with watet.</p>
                     <p>Baths of ſweet Water warmed, are to be frequented.</p>
                     <p>But carnal pleaſure, great exerciſe, faſting, thirſt, all perturbations of the mind and watching, are to be eſchewed, as adding to a dry Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper; neither is coſtiveneſs beneficial: therefore Lenitives are good, uſed now and then, to ſet the paſſages free.</p>
                     <p>In Topicals, or application, Oyls for Unction, chiefly of the fore-ſeam

The third Kind is the Megrim, poſſeſſing only one ſide of the Head, called both in Greek and Latine, <hi>Hemicrani.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of the firſt of theſe we think it convenient to treat diſtinctly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its various Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>And firſt therefore of a Diſtemper. And firſt from Heat.</p>
                     <p>A bare Diſtemper of the Quality without preſence of any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                     <p>This Diſtemper is cauſed by all ſuch things as kindle and ſtir up Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, whether internal or external.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2. External. <hi>Firſt,</hi> as Heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is a main cauſe, and happens to ſuch as ſtand long bareheaded in the <hi>Sun. Secondly,</hi> Heat of the Fire, ſpecially having a great flame. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hot Baths. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Uſe of Meats and Drinks, 1. too <hi>hot</hi> in nature, 2. vaporous, as Garlick, Leeks, Onions, Wine, &amp;c. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Keeping in an air that is heat, or naturally of too <hi>hot</hi> a temper.</p>

                        <hi>Platerus</hi> ſaith, <hi>There's a</hi> Diſpoſitio Patibibis, <hi>or a Diſpoſition of the Head to aking, without the ariſing from any manifeſt Cauſe, as may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but is rather from a too exquiſite ſence, or hereditary, or contracted by evil cuſtoms in ſuch to whom there is with it no hurt of the other Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

                     <p>The place of the Headach, ſaith <hi>Platerus,</hi> is <hi>inter Calvaria,</hi> or in the Menings of the Brain, or Brain it ſelf; in the Menings, becauſe they are endued with a ſenſe of Touch; in the ſubſtance of the Brain, (when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as 'tis inſenſible;) many think there can no pain ariſe there, but in the Nerves proceeding therefrom, in the fore and hinder part of the Head.</p>
                     <p>Sign. 1. The pain is ſomewhat violent with heat, intenſe, and to be felt, with dryneſs of the Skin.</p>

                     <p>℞ Oyls of Violets, Mandrake-Apples, and Poppies, <hi>ana</hi> ℥i. Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Sanders, Lettice-ſeed, <hi>ana</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii. Camphir, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. with white Wax as much as may be ſufficient, make it of a due thickneſs for an Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Alſo waſhing the Feet in Decoction of Houſleek, Nightſhade, Lettices, Roſes, Water-Lillies, or the like, is very good to temper the heat, and mittigate it: If yet watching be not leſſened, one or two grains of <hi>Laudanum</hi> may be given at night.</p>
                     <p>Dyet 2. Where, 1. All things that are of hard digeſtion, 2. Vaprous, as Milk, 3. Heating, are to be ſhunned.</p>
                     <p>And where are to be choſen, 1. All cooling, 2. Not fuming, 3.

Alſo in Broath may be boiled proper Herbs.</p>
                     <p>Strong Beer and all ſorts of Wine are prejudicial; Barly water, or water wherein a little Cinnamon is boyled, or tempering pleaſant Julaps are to ſerve for ordinary drinking.</p>
                     <p>I. Internals.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Cure,</hi> 1. Reſpect is to be had to the conſtitution of the Belly: by no means Coſtiveneſs is to be connived at, for thereby alone oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is pain made from vapours not permitted a paſſage, and the Body
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93369:86"/> wants the ventilation Nature requires: a cooling, emollient, lenitive Cliſter, is therefore to be premiſed.</p>
                     <p>2. Letting blood is to be inſtituted, for Evacuation of the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and correction of the hot temper of the blood: ſome like opening the veins in the foot; but commonly the Cephallick Veine of the Arm is taken; 'tis beſt done at Fall, or Spring.</p>
                     <p>3. Purging with more gentle Medicines, chiefly Aholagoges, Potions in great quantity, and Specificals for the Head.</p>
                     <p>2. Topicks: Where firſt Repellers, and Stoppers of the flowing of humours, and prohibiters of inflamation, are to be applyed: ſuch as with cooling, have a penetrive quality, and ſtupifie not much, are to be choſen; Oyl of Roſes, Emphacine, a little Vinegar added, to anoint the Head all over, firſt being ſhaven, is praiſed <hi>Lud. Septal.</hi> bids Oxir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hodes to be dropped from on high, upon the Coronal Suture, becauſe ſo they temper more, a decoction of Plantane, Red-Roſes, Purſlane, Houſleek, &amp;c. boiled in Water and Vinegar, may ſerve for a Laviment of the Forehead, Face, and Sutures: after which, the Herbs themſelves may be applyed upon the Forehead and Temples, alſo freſh Moſs, and boiled Mallows, applied to the Temples, excels.</p>
                     <p>II. Coolers. Where,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Obſerve ſuch that are of a binding quality, though cooling, as Juyce of Quinces, Medlars, &amp;c. are to be ſhunned.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such as are of a ſtupifactive Nature muſt be as warily as may be dealt withall, here; as is crude Opium, Poppies, Nightſhade, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes, Henbane, Hemlock, and Thorn Apples: yet they may more ſafely be applied to the Forehead then Sutures, which being porey, would more quickly ſnatch in their Narcotick force into the Brain, and ſo do great hurt: neither are they, as admoniſheth <hi>Lud. Septal.</hi> to be uſed ſo much for pain, as for watching, that weakens; nor are they to be inwardly taken to alter the diſtempers, except there be great watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent.</p>
                     <p>A ſelect Oyntment may be made after this manner, void of danger, and ſufficiently cooling: ℞ Oyl of Violets, Water-Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <hi>an.</hi> ℥i. Juyce of Houſleek, Ducks-Meat, Puiſlane, <hi>an.</hi> ℥ſs. Camphir, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. Seeds of Lettice, White Poppies, Cucumbers, <hi>an</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii. Wax ſufficient, make an Ointment. Theſe things may be actually cold ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, yet more warily in old People and Children: moreover, in the eſe of applications we muſt regard that they lie not too long, nor grow hot, but are oft to be removed; neither is free tranſpiration to be letting, by having the head bound up with many clothes, which greatly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93369:86"/> the heat together, which apply to the head; Padilotions alſo may be uſed profitably, made of Coolers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the Symptome, Pain, Externals are chiefly in uſe; yet 'tis not altogether frivolous to uſe cooling quieting Medicines, that quiet Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and render them milder and hinder aſcent or motion of Vapours, as ſuch an one; ℞ Water of Nightſhade, Poppies, Violets and Roſes, <hi>an.</hi> ℥iiii. Syrupes of Violets, Water-Lillies, Mints and Poppies, <hi>an</hi> ℥i. made tart with ſpirit of Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, in more urgent pain, from which both a Feaver and gathering of Humours may be ſuſpected, to give Narcoticks inwardly is not altogether irrational; nor is opening a veine in the forehead to pacifie, cool and leſſen the enkindled and fiery Spirits, alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccesful.</p>
                     <p>Topicks: Anodine, the beſt are Oyl of Dill-ſeed, of Roſes, Eldern, Purſlane, Ducks-meat, Privet, Nightſhade, Water-Lillies, Fleabane Lettice, Camphir, Cucumbers, Plantane, Houſleek, and Poplar-Buds; of theſe may Oils, Unguents, Lotions, Epithemes, Embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and Powders be made.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therefore an Oyntment of great force may be made after this manner.</p>
                     <p>℞ Oyl of Fleabane, (but, ſay Aſtronomers, the Fleabane muſt be gathered in the Hour of <hi>Mars,</hi> he being, if it be poſſible, in <hi>Aries,</hi> in a good Aſpect to the Moon) ℥i. Poplar Buds, and Eldern Buds, <hi>an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. Camphir, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. Vinegar of Roſes for penetration, <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii. with white Wax a ſufficient quantity, compoſe all for an Oyntment; with which anoint the Forehead, Temples, and about the Ears, where may be ſuffered by abſence of Hair, when pain urges, or chiefly at night, at lying down.</p>
                     <p>In the morning waſh the Face all over with Vervain, Roſe, and Flea. bane-water, and a little Vinegar in it.</p>
                     <p>Emplaiſters may be made of the afore-going Simples; but becauſe by their long lying on, they heat, and hinder the free paſſage of the hot Vapours, and Spirits, by binding up the Pores too ſtraitly, therefore Pulteſies eſpecially to be applyed in an exacerbation, are more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient fot Tranſpiration, and Ventilation: as thus,</p>
                     <p>℞ Vervain, Mints, Houſleek, <hi>an.</hi> mi; Seeds of Lettice, Mallows, and Eldern-Flowers, <hi>an.</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ii. boil all in Water and Vinegar; then drain out the ſuperflous Liquor, with which, moderately heat, bathe the places afore-directed; and then apply the Herbs, with Clothes mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſtrait bound on.</p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:93369:87"/>
                     <p>If Pain be more intenſe, and remits not with theſe gentler ſafe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, then we muſt uſe Narcoticks, ſuch as were preſcribed before for ſuch as watch over much: yet they are rather to be forborn (unleſs <hi>Delirium,</hi> Feaver or Inflamation is evidently foreſeen to follow upon the greatneſs of the pain) in Children, for their Conſtitution is colder and moiſter, that may congelemamous, and bring them into Epilepſies, and other Diſeaſes: 2. Not to old men, leſt through extinction of their weak heat, and ſtupifaction, they be brought into cold Diſeaſes, &amp;c. <hi>e Caput:</hi> 3. Not in Women of ſoft and tender Skins: 4. Not ſo fit where the Sutures are looſer; nor indeed are they fit to be laid to the Sutures, for ſo as we ſaid before, they cool and dull the Brain too much; therefore tis more ſafe to uſe them in application to the Forehead onely: 5. Nor in Catarrhous Conſtitutitutions: 6. Leſs uſeful in pain than watching, and leaſt of all in heat.</p>

                        <hi>GAllen</hi> ſaith, Pains of the Head from conſent of the Womb are chiefly ſtated in the hinder part, which alſo <hi>Lud. Mercat.</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to, by reaſon of the Veins and Arteries which about the Back do come hither; others ſay theſe vapours cauſing pain are transferred from the Womb to the hinder part of the Head and Crown, by the Nerves and ſpinal Marrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe</hi> immediate, is a matter, ſaith <hi>Sennertus,</hi> ſent from the Womb by the Veins and Arteries to the Head, and by vellicating and ſtretching out the parts effects pain, but though it may ariſe from vitious blood, or humours, yet not without a vapour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe</hi> remote is ſome vice of the Menſtrues that went before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sign.</hi> 1. It poſſeſſes the back part moſt, or for the moſt part-it doth ſo.</p>
                     <p>2. The Womb is otherwiſe affected, and the Menſtrues 'tis like have not or do not perform their legal evacuation.</p>
                     <p>3. Anxiety, palpitation, and ſwooning ſucceed from the Heart; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo drawn into conſent with the Womb by the Arteries, by which thoſe vapours are alſo communicated to the Heart.</p>
                     <p>4. Theſe pains debilitate, cauſe Watching, and much afflict the Sick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Differences</hi> of the Humour are known,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By heavineſs, and ſudden invading and ceaſing again of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93369:94"/> pain, which argues the aſcenſion of Vapours.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the contrary we may gueſs it an humour, and that 1. Either from Blood, where an heavy pain is the greateſt: 2. From Choler, which is diſcerned by gnawing and pricking: 3. From Flegm, wherein there is a greater propenſneſs to ſleep: 4. From Melancholy, wherein they are more ſad: 5. Commixtion of two or more of theſe Humours, or a windy matter together, for theſe humours are hardly pure, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but commixt, and for the moſt part wind is the chief Cauſe.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, for the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> 1. The Womb is to be looked to, that ſends matter up to the head, its vices are to be corrected: ſee an Epilepſie from conſent of the VVomb. 2. The Head that receives theſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours is to be reſpected, from whence we muſt repel and drive them back. 3. Care alſo is to be taken if they afflict the heart, then pull them back by ſharp Cliſters, ſuppreſs Frictions of the nether parts, and give Cordials.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Symptom,</hi> Pain; Of this we have treated ſufficiently in other Chapters, and think a needleſs repitition ſuperfluous.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of Headach cauſed of the Stomach.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BEfore we treated of Headach that was eſſential to the Head, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from Diſtemper, and Humours there placed.</p>
                     <p>Now we ſhall begin with all thoſe Parts that effect pain of the Head by Sympathy and Conſent, ſending thither Vapours, and communicating Humous from the communion of thoſe parts with the Head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe.</hi> Therefore we will begin with the Stomach, cauſing Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach by conſent, and which ſends corrupt and noxious Vapours, from corrupt and putrified Humours remaining there, ſpecially in the mouth of it, which diſturb and pain the Head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sign.</hi> 1. Firſt from the pain, which is not conſtant; ſecondly, But when 'tis made, it vellicates, and is ſharp; thirdly, The more hunger the ſick ſuffers, the more pain rages, for then the Humour is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed.</p>
                     <p>2. From the Stomach, which is firſt vomitiſhly diſpoſed, eſpecially if its mouth be affected; ſecondly, Nauſeating, inappetence, or the like, are often joyned.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Dyet</hi> 'tis good to uſe ſome aſtringent things, to hinder the ready exhalation of thoſe bad Humours to the Head; 2. To avoid thoſe things that ſend hurtful Vapours to the Head, as Saffron, Pine-Nuts, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are apt to encreaſe Headach, if taken inwardly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure.</hi> Here Vomits are chiefly neceſſary and helpful to bring forth the Cauſe, to wit the Humours ſeated in the Stomach; ſome wiſh the drinking of warm water, and the Patient to put a Feather, or his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into his Throat, and provoke Vomit; which may ſerve in a light Affect, but hardly effectual enough at all times.</p>
                     <p>Preparation of the Humour, which may be ſuppoſed to be viſcous, and ſtick faſt, is adviſed by others, and that not without reaſon: The beſt thing for that purpoſe is Vinegar of Squills, from ℥i. to ℥ij. according as its operation may be deſired, weaker or ſtronger, given for two or three times, then adminiſter a Vomit of Emetick Wine, or Infuſion of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93369:95"/> 
                        <hi>Crocus Metallorum;</hi> the doſe of which to men may be from ℥iſs. to ℥iiſs. Some praiſe a Radiſh Vomit with Oximel.</p>
                     <p>Vomits are of two ſorts; gentle, which onely purge the Stomach, and evacuate what they finde there; ſtrong, which draw Humours from other parts to the Stomach, and caſt them out forcibly, without any other help: but Hellebore and ſtrongeſt vomitory Medicines are not without danger; nor are mean Vomits ſafe in Ptiſſicks, or Aſthmaticks, or in Affects of the Eyes, becauſe they raiſe fumes to them.</p>
                     <p>If Vomits may not be requiſite for the Habit and Conſtitution of the Patients Stomach, Pills may carry down the Humour, and be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, they may be taken to <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ſs. or ℈ij. before ſupper, or at going to Bed, in Syrup of Violets, Pap of a roaſted Apple, or what elſe the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty beſt likes; they may be made of greateſt efficacy, according to this Example:</p>
                     <p>℞ <hi>Aloe,</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij. <hi>Senna,</hi> 
                        <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. Mint, Red-Roſe-leaves, Cinnamon, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander Seed, <hi>ana</hi> ℈i. Salt of Wormwood, ℈ſs. with Syrup of Violets make a maſs for Pills; theſe are rather convenient than Vomits, for thick, flegmatick, ſowr, and ſalt Humours, that more aptly deſcend to the bottom of the Stomach; but for Cholder that is moſt deſpoſed to float in the mouth of the Stomach, vomits are moſt helpful.</p>
                     <p>Topicals are to be made,</p>
                     <p>Firſt for the Head: 1. To ſtrengthen it, that it may not ſo eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Vapours aſcending to it: 2. To repel and drive back the Cauſe that is already received; but ſome hold theſe needleſs, and not help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but after a Vomit, and the preſcribed Stomach-Pills; Medicines applied to the Head, may together be beneficial.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For the Stomach: An Oyntment compoſed of Stomachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals and Aſtringents may hinder the diſpoſition of the Vapours ariſing from thoſe Humours upwards; but this is beſt after a Vomit, or Pills, that have firſt carried away the Humours; for if they be viſcous, by Aſtringents they may be made worſe, and more faſtened.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Corroberate both Head and Stomach, chiefly by Internals, with Medicines appropriated to them and their vices.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CAuſes</hi> are evident enough to be Liquors that fume to the Head, and diſturb the ſenſitive Faculties, and cauſe Headach; ſuch be either Wines, ſpecially generous Wines and Sack, Strong-Waters, Ale, Strong Drink, or fumes of hot Humours ſo aſcending and filling the Brain with Vapours, which if it be hot, is ſo much the more quickly taken, ſaith <hi>Galen;</hi> and ſuch as have the <hi>Os Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetrum,</hi> and Sutors cloſer ſhut, bear Drink leſs then others ere they be drunk.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Cauſe works moleſtation of the Senſes divers wayes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the occult Natures of men are diſpoſed. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In ſome it effects Raging, Staring, Swearing, Curſing, Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In others the contrary, for ſome will then be moſt complemental, moſt flattering, Smile and Laugh, and be wantonly diſpoſed.</p>
                     <p>From hence was brought that proverbial Verſe,</p>
                     <lg>

                     </lg>
                     <p n="3">3. Some are more melancholy and Stupid, forget almoſt all things, are more buſied in penſiveneſs of Mind, and more ſad.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Others be more Merry, Sing, Play, Rant it, and are Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Blaſphemous, are more vigilant, and remember things better.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs</hi> are apparent enough. 1. By dulneſs of their Eyes. 2. By the carriage of their Body. 3. By their Speech; often they Vomit, they Shutter, Babble, Stagger, and can hardly ſtand, and fall, Head akes; think all turns round; Eyes are diſpoſed to moiſture; after the Wine or Drink is a little digeſted, they ſlep, after which for the moſt part they are eaſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Progn.</hi> Though Wine be hot, it begets cold Diſeaſes, for through too much accuſtomed drinking Wine or Ale, there follows often weakneſs of the Nervs, Palſies, Trembling, Convulſion, Falling-ſickneſs and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93369:96"/> Catarrhs: if the Drunken Man be made Dumb, he will die of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, unleſs a Feaver ſupervenes, or he recovers his voice at that time wherein Surfeits are wont to be diſſolved, ſaith <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure</hi> is double, firſt Preſervative; where,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Divers Medicines are ſet down by Authors to preſerve from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Drunk. As 1. Milk drank faſting will that day defend from being Drunk. 2.

                        <p>Commonly this is a Symptom, and alwayes leſs or more at one time or other, either at beginning, middle, or end of the Feaver; 'tis an inſeparable Symptom, therefore we muſt conſider whether it be only a Concomitant Symptom, either from the beginning of both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and intermitting Feavers, or whether it urged not before the ſtate of the Feaver, by which we may judge it Critical, and curing of it is to be ſuperſeded: And ſay ſome Aſtronomers, If the Moon come to the Oppoſition of the Sign and Degree ſhe was in at the falling ſick of the affected Perſon, or if ſhe or her Beams extend ſo far as that place ſhe then was in at the Parties falling ſick, (it, as the other, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending a Decretory Haemorrhage, or bleeding at Noſtiils, or Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to follow) no Phyſick is then to be given; but if vehement and pulſant, (as in acute Feavers, with watching, redneſs of the Face and Eyes, and ſometimes with a <hi>Delirium,</hi> and coming not in the ſtate of burning and continual Feavers alone, and in the fits alwayes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Feavers) 'tis to be reſpected and mitigated: and though a Symptom, yet may be worſe than the Diſeaſe it depends upon; 1. As to its Moleſtation. 2. As to the Dangers that it may bring in ſome, eſpecially where not Vapours alone, but alſo hot and Cholerick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are carried to the Brain, or Blood, hot and much perfuſed with Choler.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cure.</hi> For its cure therefore (neglecting, as needleſs, the penning of Cauſes, or Diagnoſtick or Prognoſtick Signes, looking to the Diſeaſe it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> a Feaver, of which this is but a Symptom) Phlebotomy or breathing the Cephalick-Vein of the Arm; this may reſpect both Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Headach, though we intend here not to ſpeak of the Cauſe, the Feaver, but only of curing the Headach ariſing therein and therefrom: If it be not ſufficient in the Arm, opening a Vein of the Forehead, or Arteriotomy, is greatly praiſed by ſome; and experience hath often found not only ſucceſsful, but ſafe alſo: Hereby the Fiery and Feaveriſh Spirits that are in the Blood, and ſent to the Head, from conſent of the whole Body, are let out.</p>
                        <p>2. Keep the Body ſoluble, for coſtivenes in Feavers often cauſes the aſcent of Vapours (their free paſſage downwards being narrowed) which moleſt and pain the Head; we may not uſe Purgatives of any great ſtrength, leſt they enkindle the Feaver more.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE treated before of Headach from diſtemper without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of any Humours: Now we treat of it diverſly, from ſeveral kindes of Humours, of which it is cauſed: And firſt of Blood; not humerous, but pure, unmixed, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending onely in quantity. The Greeks call it <hi>Phlethora,</hi> the Latines <hi>Plenitudo,</hi> in Engliſh Plethory, Plenitude or Fulneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe.</hi> Firſt, 'Tis made,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Originally from Plenitude and abounding of Blood in the Body, made from things too much nouriſhing and increaſing Blood whether Meats or Drinks, being too plentifully taken.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To this adde the omitting of Exerciſes, Sweatings, and Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, natural or artificial, as Bleeding, Purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, 'Tis brought into Action (being thicker or thinner, more or leſs ſpirituous, colder or hotter, ſharp or milder, or leſs humerous and pure) from too great affects, which bring either heat or pain to the Head, ſo that the Blood filling the large dimenſions of the Brain is over-heat, whence follows heat and diſtentive pain, yet acquires it not ſuch a heat, as that a <hi>Delirium</hi> ſhould follow.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Particular <hi>Cauſes</hi> that both attract and make this Blood to pain, be chiefly,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Drinking of Wine.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The Temple-Veins beat more ſtrong and luſtily than thoſe at the Wriſts, and the pulſative faculty is very great and vehement.</p>

                     <p>PAin of the Head from windineſs is a diſtentive painful ſenſe of feeling in the Head, from wind made from its generative Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and either gathered there from weakneſs, or tranſmitted from inferiour parts from their repletion.</p>

                        <hi>Cauſe</hi> is circular motion of the animal Spirits, made from aireal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or an exhaling matter, exciting great agitation and moleſtuous diſturbance of the imaginary faculties.</p>
                     <p>Cauſes of theſe vapours are twofold: 1. Primary, whereof they are made: 2. Secundary, whereby they are put upon action.</p>

                     <p>External Cauſes are either Objects ſet before the eyes, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther low, and ſteep-down low places, and the cauſe is natural, for fear diſſipates the Spirits, and frighting recals them to the center, whence they are hurried in a contrary motion.</p>
                     <p>Or things that turn round, and whisk about, as Whirl-pools, Wind-Mills, Wheels, and the like, whence the beholding of ſuch, cauſes a circumvolution alſo of the viſive Spirits, which communicate ſuch a

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dyet,</hi> in what cauſe ſoever, is to be modelized of Meats eaſie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, and of pure Nutriment; all windy things ſhunned, Crudity and Drunkenneſs, too great ſatiety, or faſting, uſe of Onions, Leeks, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed, old Wine, Milk, Garlick, Radiſh, and things of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not to be permitted: wholſomer food is River-Crabs, Partridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Pheaſants, ſcaley Fiſhes, Veal, Pullets, and Chickens, Meats that are pleaſant to the Pallate, not vaporous, ſauced with ſome Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents that prohibit the aſcent of hurtful vapours from the Stomach, are to be allowed him; white Wine is allowed for drink ſometimes, but where the affect is grown inveterate, Phyſicians commend <hi>Guaicum</hi>-Drink to be drunk for their ordinary Beer.</p>
                     <p>Air Auſtral, or hot and moiſt, is to be avoided, ſo is alſo cloudy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Sunſhine too ſometimes hurtful; they are not to be permitted to ſee things that turn quick about, or to look from ſteep high places;

                     <p>Let ſleep be moderate, and let him be two hours always, or above, ere he lies down to ſleep; ſleep doth ſome much good, becauſe it diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vapours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cure</hi> is firſt directed to the Cauſe, ſecondly to the Part.</p>
                     <p>I. The <hi>Cauſes</hi> are various, and therefore the method of curing cannot be one and the ſame: For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If Phlethory offend, and Blood abound too copiouſly in the Head, it is neceſſary, 1. To reſpect the whole, as by opening of the Hepatick Vein of the Arm: 2. The Head, by opening the Arteries behinde the Ears by a skilful Artiſt; but Blood is gradually to be drawn away, for ſome fall upon every light occaſion: Cupping-glaſſes, with Scarificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may alſo be applied to the hinder part of the Head.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If Flegm and groſs crude Humours be impacted in the Head, after preparation thereof, they are to be purged forth; Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to be followed, as by rubbing and bindings, Gargariſms, Sternu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatories, and Errhines, the two laſt whereof are condemned by <hi>Septali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> becauſe Vapours being inordinately moved in the Brain, the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is exacerbated, and an Epilepſie ſooner made, whenas little of the Morbifick matter is extracted thereby: Cauteries are to be applied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Ears, chiefly to the <hi>Sinciput,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zach. Luſitanus;</hi> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Baths, ſpecially thoſe flowing from Allom, are good; alſo Embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and Topicks, to digeſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If Indications of a Cholerick or Atrabilatious Humour abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Head, be preſent, they are cured as Headach, and diſtemper of the Head from thoſe Humours.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If windy Exhalations and bad Vapours, either in the Head, or other inferiour parts, be cauſe hereof, Repel by <hi>Oxirhodinum,</hi> give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly things that ſtop and ſettle vapours; revulſe, where Cliſters and Suppoſitories are good; Frictions alſo and Ligatures for averſion; Odours are to be held to the Noſtrils, that amend and correct the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thoſe fumes, and by a propriety help a <hi>Vertigo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>II. Reſpect the <hi>Part:</hi> Where if the Cauſe lie primarily in the Brain, the Brain is to be purged, as afore, then ſtrengthened by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Externals.</p>
                     <p>If from conſent of the inferiour Bowels, Cure is to be directed to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93369:104"/> them; where if the Stomach ſuppeditate vapours to the Head, a Vomit for bringing forth of putrified Humours is ſometimes very effectual; then give Alortick Pills, both to cleanſe and ſtrengthen the faculty of good digeſtion: Aſtringent Powders are always to be given after meat, to prohibit and rectifie vapours.</p>
                     <p>2. If from a putrifaction of Cholerick Humours in the Meſentery-Veins vapours are tranſmitted to the Head, prepare with Wormwood-Wine, and the five Opening-Roots, then purge forth that Humour, and keep back Vapours ariſing from thence.</p>
                     <p>3. If from other Bowels, as Liver, Spleen, Inteſtines, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonders; we muſt diligently look into, and correct the vice of thoſe parts, evacuate the Humours there ſeated, and intercept their vapours, whoſe Remedies, as things alſo for all other intentions, are to be found out in the liſt of Medicines that are held to help a <hi>Vertigo</hi> from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and ſpecifical quality in them; and they may be variouſly uſed and applied, according to the Cauſes, and preceding Inſtitution.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe things therefore that help a <hi>Vertigo</hi> by a propriety, or an hidden Sympathetical or Antipathetical Quality in them, are Southern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, whoſe Decoction in Wine taken often (as all others are to be) is ſaid to be a moſt effectual Remedy; nor leſs praiſe hath the Hear Bitterſweet, born about the Neck in manner of a Garland; or Vinegrb of Squills taken every morning faſting, Syrup of the ſharp Juyce of Cit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </argument>
                     <p>LOVE is a depravation of the Phantaſie, erring from Judgment, and ariſing from an inward Cauſe affecting the Heart with Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon the apprehenſion and pondering upon the outward Subject.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cauſe</hi> is obſcure, nor can the Reaſon hereof ſufficiently be rendered; onely ſuch as are ſo deeply in love, are ſuch as for the moſt part are very ſubject to be altered, and have their Paſſions moved upon every light Cauſe, as will quickly fligger with Joy, or deſpair with Sadneſs; ſome attribute it more ſpecially to redundancy of the Seed, and Idleneſs; whence <hi>Ovid</hi> writ,</p>

                     <p>Some call it the Noblemans Madneſs, but Poor are ſtrook with <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi>'s Dart as well as Rich.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Signs</hi> are not always the ſame of all; the Pulſe in moſt is very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, either very high, or very low, very unconſtant; whence <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtratus</hi> found out Love-Sickneſs: when they are dejected and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, their Pulſe is very ſmall and low; but if their Love be but talked of, or come in ſight, or they hear any joyful news thereof, preſently their Pulſe is augmented.</p>
                     <p>2. When they are in deſpair, or cannot have Him or Her that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, they mourn, lament, ſigh, are very thoughtful, forget to eat their Food at due ſeaſons, cannot ſlep, nor are at all delighted in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of their Buſineſſes; but when they are elavated by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or good news from him, or talking of him, they break forth into exceeding Joy; ſing, play on Muſick, talk many laſcivious and fond Sentences; yea, and ſometimes are very forward, and offer themſelves to perpetrate unlawful Copulation.</p>
                     <p>3. After ſome continuance of time, with anxieties, ſolicitudes, and deplored thoughtfulneſs of mind, they grow very pale, which is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to all.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, Some through deſpair either turn mad, and are diſtracted,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93369:105"/> or elſe lay violent hands, or make away themſelves, or bring themſelves into other grievous Diſeaſes, that kill them in the end.</p>

                        <hi>Cure.</hi> They will not uſe any Remedy, nor hear any Advice, nor receive any comfort, nor hardly have their thoughts diverted, and ſet on any other Object, or Subject. If they be laſcivious, and abound with Blood, it is good to let them Blood, let them uſe a thin and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Dyet; and ſuch things as cool, enervate, and conſume the Seed; let them have ſome employment ſet them that may buſie their Mind, and indulge venerious thoughts the leſs: If they incline to a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly temper, things, and the Method ordained for Melancholicks are proper, onely avoiding ſuch things as increaſe Seed, and provoke to Venery.</p>
                     <p>If they be diſtracted and delire, they muſt be cured as Mad People.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes Medicines are given to cauſe Love, which the Latines call <hi>Philtra,</hi> which bring the Party taking them into a raving and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs condition after the Party deſired; or elſe are ſuch as vehemently ſtir up luſt; as many Whoremongers uſe to give Cantharides for that purpoſe, which do not cauſe mutual Love, but by their Acrimony mightily tickle and irritate to Venery.</p>

                     <p>DImneſs of Sight, or Blindneſs, is a defect of Seeing, either perfectly, or unrightly, made from want of viſive Spirits, Obſtructions of the Optick Nerves, or other Cauſes hurting the viſive faculty, no vice or ſpot being to be ſeen in the Eye.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>CAUSE</head>
                        <p>Is either from the fewneſs of Spirits, as happens after long Diſeaſes, or from the Brain not ſupplying Animal Spirits, or from fault of the Animal Spirits, which are thickned, cooled, and weakned, as in old men, whenas they ought to be Iucid, thin, and many; and then it is called <hi>Amblyopia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. From the Optick Nerves; which are, 1. Obſtructed either by Melancholy, or Flegmatick Humours falling from the Head, as in a Palſey, ſo that the Optick Spirits cannot paſs to the Eyes. 2. From Conſtriction as well as Obſtruction of thoſe Nerves, is <hi>Amblyopia</hi> made, they are narrowed and compreſſed divers ways; for in Phrenſies, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, and other Diſeaſes of Plentitude of Blood, from Bruiſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whence <hi>Pus</hi> is gathered, and Tumours compreſſing the Nerves, ſo that the Spirits cannot paſs, as hath been found in thoſe that have been opened. 3.

                        <p>Some adde a third kind, <hi>viz. Myopia,</hi> which is whenas they ſee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is nigh them, made from weakneſs of the viſive Spirits, and thickning of the Coats from Humours.</p>
                        <p>Antecedent and generative Cauſes were,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Crudities and Drunkenneſs.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Reading, and that after meat, and of ſmall Letters, or by Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-light.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. An evil-kind of Dyet, meats of bad digeſtion, and exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>

                        <p n="6">6. The immoderate uſe of Venery, paſſions of the mind, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>

                        <p n="8">8.

                        <p>There is no vice appearing in the Eye, ſo that ſight by degrees grows dimmer and weaker, and no film, cloud or ſpot is ſeen in the Pupil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that the Pupil be larger, and more big then naturally accuſtomed, and ſometimes black.</p>
                        <p>There is ſometime like a Gnat before the Eye, a little obliquely, which ſhadow is ſeen moſt in an open and clear Air; it groweth bigger in time, and there is another made to it, ſo that whither ſoever the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient looks, if it be abroad in a light time, theſe two ſhadows are always like two Gnats, a little obliquely before their Eyes.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, we muſt gueſs at the Cauſe and Diſeaſe by the foregoing, of things hurtful by Pain, Heavineſs, Fulneſs, and Heat in the Head, that preceded, whereby were the noxious Humours tranſlated to the Optick Nerves: if none of theſe preceded, and we cannot gather that they are either obſtructed or conſtrict, we may ſuppoſe the fault to be in the Optick Spirits, and the more if from old Age.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Amauroſis</hi> is ſoon made ſometimes, but <hi>Amblyopia</hi> by degrees.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Amblyopia</hi> therefore is better than <hi>Amauroſis,</hi> becauſe in that ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious a ſtoppage of the Nerves is not ſuddenly made, whence 'tis alſo eaſilier cured.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Amauroſis</hi> is bad, becauſe the Nerves obſtructed are hard to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as in Palſeys; yet if imperfect ſeeing be onely made, there is hope, though it yields not after the uſe of much Phyſick; if it be made from conſtriction of thoſe Nerves, it ceaſes upon the taking away or ceaſing of the Cauſe that cruſhed the Nerves together: If it come ſuddenly from violent vomiting, by taking another Vomit the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours have been taken from thence, that were moved thither by the ſame Cauſe before; the like alſo, if it come from diſturbance of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93369:108"/> from violent Purgers, 'tis taken away by Purging again.</p>
                        <p>Women with Child at time of Delivery, or before, are delivered from their Blindneſs; but old men hardly recover ſight again, becauſe the defect in them made through Age, cannot be repaired. If ſight in ſick men fails ſuddenly, it argues death.</p>
                        <p>If Humours be more looſly ſeated about the Nerves, though they have been very dim for a long time, yet there is great hopes of Cure; ſpecially if the Sick ſhutting the ſound Eye, the Pupil or Apple of the other be dilated.</p>

In a black and clear, there's no Cure; here the Eye-lids move much in a trembling faſhion, the original Cauſe is from the Mothers Womb, and therefore they that have theſe, are for the moſt part born blind; the Nerves Optick are ſtopped, and their faculty mortified, therefore all trial of cure is in vain; though many to their end ſee the light of the Sun, or ſtature of a Man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Copulation doth yet much hurt in this; the colour ſhews the Humour of which they are made.</p>

                        <p>3. <hi>Barrow:</hi> The third kind of incurable Cataract is, when the Pupil of the Eye is dilated, and ſpread ſo far that there's no circle ſeen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Tunicle of the Eyes; and the Eyes ſhew totally affected either with Blackneſs or Whiteneſs, all over.</p>

                        <p>In place they differ, for ſome be in the center of the Apple, where objects are repreſented pertuſe, ſeem holey, as if <hi>feneſtris,</hi> and 'tis bad trying cure by the Needle, leſt the whole Pupil be filled.</p>
                        <p>2. Some be betwixt the <hi>Urea</hi> and <hi>Cornea,</hi> and then the Apple is ſeen more deeply to be darkened, and is of neceſſity dilated from the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour diſtending.</p>
                        <p>3. Another is betwixt the <hi>Urea</hi> and Cryſtalline Humour, and then things appear oppoſite.</p>

                        <hi>MYdriaſis</hi> is a dilatation of the Pupil, or enlarging of it beyond Nature, about the Circle of the <hi>Iris,</hi> from natural conformation, or accidentary Cauſes, and is a Diſeaſe of bad Conformation.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>CAUSE</head>
                        <p>Ariſes either from a natural conformation from the Birth, or preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes, whereof the proximate, internal and immediate is a ſtretching forth of the <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rea,</hi> of which the Pupil is the hole: This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſion of the <hi>Urea</hi> is effected two ways; 1. By dryneſs, that ſtretches out the <hi>Urea,</hi> even as we ſee in holey skins dried; this dryneſs alſo hath a cauſe, as Watchings, Feavers, and other drying Cauſes. 2. By moiſture, which cauſes an enlargement and diſtention of every Part, and makes the Parts to ſwell forth beyond their accuſtomed bounds, and that are allotted by Nature. This alſo is cauſed by too much abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the watery Humour, by flux of ſerous Humours inſinuated there, which are the primitive or remote Cauſes; diſtenſion alſo is made from winds, as in Child-bearing.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, ſolution of the continuity of the <hi>Urea,</hi> cauſes the ſpace of the Pupil, or Apple of the Eye to be enlarged; this is done by Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Wounds, whence a dilatation is ſuddenly made.</p>
                        <p>External Cauſes are bruiſings and falls from high, whereby the <hi>Urea</hi> is broke, or diſtorted, or a flux or congeſtion of Humours made.</p>

                        <p>Diagnoſtick Signs are taken, 1. From a preternatural bigneſs of the Pupil, that is to be ſeen about the <hi>Iris,</hi> and is ſo enlarged that it equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes the circumference of the <hi>Iris,</hi> and then it is more eaſily known. 2. From ſight mutilated, which according to the greatneſs of the affect is leſſened more or leſs; and they ſee beſt in dark places, being the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Species and Objects are thus much illuſtrated, and light goes in too plentifully; therefore a mean bigneſs of the Pupil is moſt requiſite for right ſeeing; and they that go out of the light into the dark, ſcarce ſee, becauſe therefrom the Pupil is ſuddenly contracted; but after their ſtay in the dark, from the Pupil dilating by degrees, they ſee better, all things ſeem leſs to them, they cannot well look upon the ground or down-right.</p>

                        <p>Hardneſs and thickneſs of Gums hinder the readier budding forth, and ſo cauſes more pain.</p>

                        <p>3. From Humours, there is extuberancy, ſoreneſs and itching; which Humours being ſharp, are caſt down from the Head; or ſalt and ſharp Humours do ariſe from the lower parts by the <hi>Oeſophagus,</hi> and are tranſlated to the Lips.</p>

                     <p>VVRithing of the Mouth, or a Convulſion of the Jaws, ariſes from a depraved motion of the Muſcles or Nerves, drawing awry the Mouth and Skin of the Face.</p>

                     <p>HOarſneſs is a Depravation of the Voice, from an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour falling upon Wind-Pipe, and making of it rough.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>CAUSE.</head>
                        <p>The Cauſe is a defluxion of Rheumatick Humours from the Head to the ſharp Artery, or Winde-pipe, made either through cold weakening the retentive faculty of the Brain, or heat diſſolving and pouring forth Humours, whoſe collection and generation came from moiſtening Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or airy Exhalations from the Stomach, which turned to a wateriſh matter which preceded, and were either from too much Drink, Wines, Bathes, moiſtening Meats, and raw Fruits, and other things, ſending many moiſt Vapours to the Head.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of an Aſthma, or hurt of breathing.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AN <hi>Aſthma</hi> is an hurt of breathing, with noiſe and frequency, ariſing from a pertinacious Obſtruction of the Lungs and its Veſſels, or Compreſſion thereof, and afflicting without a Feaver.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Respiration</hi> is the proper action of the Lungs, which we ought to know what its right <hi>medium</hi> and conſtitution is in bodies not affected, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may alſo diſtinguiſh how much it is depraved; it is twofold, free or ſtrait; Free Reſpiration is a facility of Breathing, with little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cheſt, from the Middriff and Lungs rightly conſtituted, and not diſeaſed, whereby it is voluntarily leſſened or enlarged, drawn in or ſent out, more quickly or ſlowly, and is called Natural Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Unnatural Reſpiration is very divers and various, according to its celerity or rarity, greatneſs or ſmallneſs, motion and reſpite, equal or inequal. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Macropnaea</hi> is a Vice of Breathing, wherein plenty of Air by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration diſtends the Breſt exceedingly, and the whole <hi>Thorax</hi> is moved by all the Muſcles, becauſe the Heart (for cooling of which, breathing is ordained) being over-heat, as in Feavers, or almoſt ſuffocated with fuliginous Vapours, requires much Air to fan and cool it by inſpiration, and ſends out many fuliginous Vapours in expiration.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Tachypnaea</hi> is a greater and more frequent reſpiration from the ſame Cauſes, being greater.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third kind of depraved breathing is called <hi>Dyſpnaea,</hi> or a ſhort breathing.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Aſthma,</hi> which is more frequent drawing of Breath.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Orthopnaea,</hi> whenas the ſick are forced to ſtand upright to fetch their Breath.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Apnaea,</hi> or an ablation or total aboliſhing of ſenſible reſpiration, wherein is great danger of Suffocation; it comes ſometimes from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Toad-ſtools, ſometimes from ſwoonding, and in ſuffocation of the Womb, wherein the Heart is thought to be ventilated, refreſhed, and cooled by Tranſpiration, or Perſpiration, of which it being the Author, and all the whole Body being ſpirable, within and without, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> why may not perſpiration by the pores of the Body ſupply the Heart in defect of reſpiration? and <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, If that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:93369:160"/> pores of the Skin be obſtructed, ſo that Tranſpiration is prohibited, and ſo conſequently the fuliginous vapours retained, putrid Feavers are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whoſe <hi>Baſis</hi> is the Heart.</p>

                        <head>SUBJECT.</head>
                        <p>Subject is either the Lungs, Middriff, or ſharp Artery, and the Organs of breathing by the Animal Spirits and Nerves.</p>

                        <head>CAUSES.</head>
                        <p>Cauſes of <hi>Aſthma</hi> are either obſtruction of the Lapets and Griſles of the Lungs, by a thick flegmatick impacted matter, or ſtones, and crude Tubercles, riſen in its ſubſtance, and cauſing obſtruction either through weakneſs of the Lungs, and then it is gathered and made by degrees, or from vice of other parts, which tranſmit ſuch a matter to the Lungs. <hi>Sennertus</hi> thinks it to come from the Liver by the <hi>Vena Arterioſa,</hi> becauſe Aſthmaticks are ſo often Cachectick, and have their feet ſwell; and though Catarrhs be preſent, whereby it may be thought that the matter falls from the Head, and is thickned and dried in the Lungs, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Cough would be made, if the Humours came by the ſharp Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from the Head to the Lungs, he doth not think the matter comes from the Head, and becauſe ſometimes it ceaſes without expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                        <p>Or, 2. Conſtriction of the Pipes and Veſſels of the Lungs or Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driff, which may come, 1. Through dryneſs, as in Ptiſſicks, ſpecially when they are nigh Death. 2. From the ſmoak and fume of Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of Coals, Lime, anointing with Quickſilver, groſs Vapours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the Womb to the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> and Pipes of the Lungs, cauſe a conſtriction, ſtraitening and narrowing of thoſe parts.</p>
                        <p>Or, 3. Compreſſion of the Lungs and Middriff, which is made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. Through plenty of Blood, as in the Haemorrhoids ſtopt, whence the parts of Breathing are ſtraitened by compreſſing and cruſhing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Or, 2. of Water, as in Dropſies, by whoſe turgency and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, diſtention of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is made, ſo that a compreſſion of the Lungs and Middriff is made therefrom, whereby free breathing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedited, and hurt. 3. From ſwelling alſo of the Liver, Spleen, or other Bowels, or extraneous Bodies, cauſing Compreſſion of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid parts, cauſe a <hi>Dyſpnaea,</hi> or ſhort breathing. 4. From abundance of Vapours collected in the inferiour Ventricle, ſometime being more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign, ſometimes malignant, which are carried to the Middriff, and hinder its free motion and Office of Reſpiration.</p>
                        <p>To theſe alſo may be added Defluxions of a thin matter falling upon
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93369:160"/> the Muſcles of the Breſt, and ordained for its motion, or intercoſtal Muſcles and Nerves of the Middriff, ſo that free motion and acting of thoſe parts is impedited, and hindered; or the Spondils of the Back luxated inwardly, or lying along on their Backs, whence the Breſt falls upon the Back, and the way of the Breath is made more narrow, and ſo <hi>Orthopnicks</hi> are ſuffocated.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>SIGNS.</head>
                        <p>Signs are more common: As, 1. Thick and frequent breathing, which is aggravated by running, or great ſtirring, by lying on their Back, or taking cold, to which the Lungs and Middriff are expoſed, and very obnoxious too: Or, 2. A Cough from a matter in the Lungs: 3. A noiſe or ratling in breathing, from the Air breaking through the parts obſtructed by a pituitous matter: 4. Expiration is eaſier than Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for in that the Inſtruments do ſpontaneouſly fall down, being void of Air, that ſtretched out their Capacity; but in this they are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be raiſed and diſtended to receive the Air, that is to be drawn in, from the agglutination of the matter, and heavineſs, oppreſſion and weakneſs of the Organs of Reſpiration.</p>
                        <p>Or leſs common; which come from particular Cauſes: As, 1. From a defluxion upon the intercoſtal and Muſcles of the Breſt, and then the Breſt is moved heavily, and there is great pain thereof: 2. From a crude Tubercle, or botch in the Lungs; there is a Feaver preſent if it be apoſtematous, and this being ſuppurated, the matter is caſt out with the Cough; if onely an excreſcent ſwelling, or ſome outgrowing Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercle, or ſtony hard concrete matter, ſticking in the ſubſtance of the Lungs, then the Symptoms and ſhort breathing encreaſed gradually as that encreaſed; they are not ſo much troubled with difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they have no Feaver, the Diſeaſe is continual, and they are ſound: The ſame Signs alſo are preſent in obſtruction of the Lungs and Wind-Pipe from a glutinous flegmatick thick Humour, onely that <hi>Stertor,</hi> or a ratling noiſe in breathing is alſo preſent. 3. If the Cauſe be from the Liver, then there are Signs of the Liver being weak and ill-affected, there is a Cachexy, or ill habit of the whole Body, <hi>Cloroſis,</hi> ſtopt Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, and ſwellings of the feet. 4. If the Cauſe come from the Head, as Catarrhs do, (which ſometimes in an high degree ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or <hi>Quarchn,</hi> as the Vulgar term it) it is more periodick, or comes at times; moleſts chiefly in Autumn and Winter, and is worſt on Nights.</p>

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:93369:161"/> from other parts to the Lungs; another by degrees, and congeſtion of an Humour more thick, and pertinaciouſly adhering: Differences alſo are made from parts offended and offending; from Cauſes alſo, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Conſtriction, or Obſtruction, of all which we have ſufficiently ſpoken heretofore.</p>

                        <p>In Cure, Conſideration of Dyet and Regiment is firſt to be had, wherein obſerve theſe things: If it be from a Flegmatick matter obſtructing, as moſt often it is, Dyet muſt be heating and drying, with which Attenuaters, and Cutters of a thick matter are meet to be mixt; Partridges, Capons, Hens, are good, which are rather to be roaſted then boiled; Fleſh of Fiſh, Fruits and Pulſe are bad and engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der crude and clammy Humours; Drink is to be little, becauſe by fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoſity and diſtention of the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> or Midriff, the evil is encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if they thirſt, Meats muſt be leſs hot, becauſe the heart is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat; Drink is then often to be held in the Mouth to moiſten, ſay ſome; but others, more wiſely, adviſe to drink freely, ſo the thick matter is made thinner; Air is to be hot alſo and dry; the Breaſt is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be rubbed gently; Exerciſe is to be moderate.</p>
                        <p>In an hot Cauſe and dry, as in Ptiſſicks, Inflamation of the Lungs, and a Feaver, the contrary to theſe are to be uſed and endeavoured.</p>

                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p n="1">1. Internals: 1. Generals, letting Blood by the Ham or Ankle-Vein: 2. Purging at firſt is in, no wiſe to be uſed, becauſe by ſtirring Humours, and making them have recourſe to the diſeaſed part, it much aggravates the Evil, and for this Cauſe Fluxes of the Belly at this time are to be ſtopt.</p>
                        <p>Cliſters to bring forth hard Dung that may cauſe preſſure of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of mild and emollient Medicines, are very allowable.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Externals: 1. We uſe Repellers, upon theſe we muſt not inſiſt too much, becauſe the Bladder is membranous, and may by coldneſs hurt ſinewy parts: 2. Hinder free paſſing out of the Urine: 3. Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit reſolution of Humours: Things are to be applied actually warm, and their repelling Vertue counter-poiſed with Anodines and Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the Bladder inflamed indures not, ſo well as the Reins, aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
                        <p>If pain urges much, we may adde <hi>Opium</hi> to Oyntments; Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms and Emplaiſters are not ſo good as Bathings, Lotions, Foments, or Unguents, becauſe by their weight they preſs and cruſh the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                        <p>A Liniment of VVhite-Bread-Crums, boild ſomewhat thick in Oyl of Roſes, with a little Saffron and Camphir, with ſome grains of <hi>Opium,</hi> if pain be very intenſe, is very helpful: Some uſe Foments of hot water applied in Oxes Bladders. Inſeſſions to ſit in are very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the aforeſaid purpoſes, then the Sick may better void the Urine.</p>
                        <p>Then we muſt come to Reſolvers of the matter into <hi>Pus,</hi> which is done by Emollients and Suppuratives. If we fear its turning gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenous, a Cataplaſm of <hi>Orobus,</hi> Beans and Lupines boild in Wine, is to be applyed.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, The Symptomes are to be reſpected, as a Feaver, VVatching, Raving, Iſchury, and Diſury; a Syringe is ſometimes put
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:93369:170"/> into the Neck of the Bladder, to bring forth the Urine. See the Cure of theſe in their proper Chapters.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Revulſion by Frictions, Bindings, Cuppers, with Scarification up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the part, are directed; yet Cupping-Glaſſes are condemned by ſome, as bringing more hurt than profit.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Blood is to be cooled; and humours tempered, and pain appeaſed; Julaps, Emulſions, and Cliſters may ſerve hereto, alſo Anodine Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories, or little Bags wherein are put Yolks of Eggs, with <hi>Opium,</hi> and Juyce of Henbane; but 'tis better to boil Poppy-ſhells, Camphir, Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, and Henbane-Seeds, in Oyl, and therein dip Wool, and wear that in the <hi>Anus</hi> ſo long as may be convenient.</p>
                        <p>We muſt not uſe any Diuretick Medicines, nor any Irritaters, ſalt, ſharp, or erodent Things; nor may they drink much; the Urine is to be kept milde, and made ſlippery, that thereby the Bladder be the leſs offended.</p>

                        <p>1. That Heat indicates Coolers to be neceſſary, cold indicates Heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be neceſſary; and ſo for drineſs and moiſture, their contraries; and for compound Diſtempers, if heat and drineſs be conjoyned, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications are for cooling and moiſtening Medicines; and if cold and moiſture be adjoyned, we muſt heat and dry by Medicines, as well outwardly applyed, as inwardly taken.</p>

                        <p>3. In a bare Diſtemper there is no need of Purgers, becauſe we do not ſuppoſe that Choler, Flegm, or Melancholy are preſent, but that by their aforegoing, they may effect a Diſtemper to the <hi>Uterus;</hi> and we treat here onely of the Diſtemper, and not of hot, cold, dry or moiſt Humours.</p>
                        <p>4.

                        <p>Cure is treble: 1. To ſtop its generation in a Scirrhous matter.</p>
                        <p>2. For a whole Cancer.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, To prohibit the turning cancerous of Scirrhs, or mutation of the ſcirrhous matter into a Cancer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Letting Blood is thought very conducible; it may be made in Ham or Arm, chiefly in Haemorrhoids, for they vent out groſs feculent parts of the Blood, and avert: Bleeding is beſt in Spring and Fall; if ſhe have not her <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> chuſe the <hi>Saphena</hi>-Vein.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, If the matter be already made cancerous, and the Cancer hath received growth, though not brought to perfection, there is little hope of Cure; if confirmed, there is none: Here, if there be any hope of Cure, (after uſing of Generals, as in the Direction for preventing its growth, is inſtituted) we muſt flee to Specificals, but mild, for 'tis apt eaſily to be enraged, and pain to exacerbate; therefore injections of <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum Saturni,</hi> beat in a Leaden Morter, with Juyce of River-Crabs, are ſpecifical; Decoction of Frogs, or Herb-<hi>Robert</hi> ſo injected, Oyntments of <hi>Pompholix,</hi> Ceruſs, Camphir, <hi>Saccarum Saturni,</hi> Oyl of Roſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a Cataplaſm of Frogs boyled, are ſpecifical.</p>
                        <p>If it be conſumed, we muſt onely uſe Palliatives, that miſery may be the leſs, and life the longer; the part being now hardened, 'tis moſt difficult to mollifie it, and reſtore it to its former ſanity; therefore the chief thing now muſt be mittigation of the pain; Injections of emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Anodine Simples, with Sperm of Frogs, Foments and Inſeſſions, are to be had in uſe; Narcoticks and great Dallers of the pain, in more urging Torments, are allowable.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, If ulcerate, we muſt accommodate Medicines to it, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Mineral-Waters, Dryers, Dullers of Acrimony, and Protracters of its augmentation, the Aſhes of River-Crabs waſht in Nightſhade-Water, mixt with Lead, or Antimony, is much truſted to by ſome in an ulcerate Cancer.</p>

                        <p>In Cure, 1. Blood-letting is to be ſuperſeded, unleſs, 1. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be Phlethorick and Sanguine-coloured, young, luſty, and in the Spring time (for letting Blood weakens the inbred heat, and extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93369:179"/> the Spirits.) 2. If the Diſeaſed wants her accuſtomed Evacuation by the <hi>Uterus,</hi> a Vein of the Ankle may be opened, with repetition. Or, 3. if the Haemorrhoids be ſuppreſt, Nature having uſed to make a vent that way, are to be opened by Leeches.</p>
                        <p>2. Purging (to which ſome premiſe Preparets, which unleſs there be thick Humours preſent, are uſeleſs; for Water neither concocts nor is made thick) which ſaith <hi>Hartman, Doth little good, unleſs when the vice proceeds from Liver or Spleen, then Antimonial Pills ſhew their effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Diureticks excel Purgers, but are not ſo excellent as in General Dropſies; the beſt are the Roots of Flower-de-luce, Bark of Eldern, and of the Roots of Danewort, Saldonellas, Horſe-Radiſh-Roots, Juniper and Broom burnt to Aſhes, and ſteeped in White-Wine, and the Wine drunk: Medicines alſo from their ſpecifical affinity to the part, are rather to be choſen, being good for Dropſies, than thoſe that reſpect the part not at all.</p>
                        <p>4. Education of the Water by Injections, by Semi-Cups, or Half-Tubs, by Foments, or a Pultis of <hi>Saldonella</hi> to the Privities, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; Iſſues are not good, but Peſſaries, Cliſters, and Emplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſuch as are preſcribed in the general Cure of Dropſies, are helpful: the skin of a Sheep new killed, and being yet warm, ſprinkled with Wine, and applyed to the Belly, is commended.</p>
                        <p>5. Openers and Movers of the monthly <hi>Menstrua,</hi> if they be ſtopt, or flow not rightly, are chiefly to be inſiſted upon; Chalybrate Pills, and Hiſtericks, having alſo a diuretick force and drying, are to be choſen.</p>
                        <p>6. Carminatives, either by the Mouth, or in Fomentations, or in Cliſters, are to be uſed, becauſe commonly there is great plenty of windineſs, which diſturbs much.</p>
                        <p>If the Water ſtick faſt in little Bladders and Skins, and be not educti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or to be brought forth, Cliſters are often to be given, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, with Emeticks, may chance to break thoſe Pellicles by its tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and plucking working; great and ſtrong exerciſe alſo, leaping, jumping, and the like, may ſometime break-them, and cauſe them to ſend forth their Water.</p>

No perceivance of its Body for many months, and then an hard ſenſleſs and immovable Body, is perceived. 2. There ſometimes follows a pricking pain, which is not in a true Conception. 3. The Woman perceives a motion like trembling and panting, diſtinct from that of the Infant. 4. Though the Breſts ſwell, there is no Milk, it is from ſuppreſt <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua,</hi> and they flag afterward. 5. It differs in the bulk and figure of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> for in a true Conception it is chiefly lifted up towards the Navil, and ſoftly ſtraitened towards the ſides; but in this the Belly is lifted up into all its dimenſions. Secondly, From a Dropſie of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> for in that there is a ſoft ſwelling, it yeilds to preſſion of the Hand and Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and the dints made therefrom, riſe again in height, there is a rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and ſenſe of water; which things are not ſo in a <hi>Mola,</hi> though a Dropſie may follow, and be conjoyned with it in time.</p>

To hinder its growth and encreaſe, and take away its aliment, for which Blood is to be drawn forth by the Arm and Ankles; Copulation, adding more weak Seed, is to be ſhunned; the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> are to flow, and we muſt purge tenacious and vitious Humours from the <hi>Ute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> In Dyet, all fat, cold, groſs, viſcous, windy Meats are to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; let her drink Wormwood Beer or Wine: Exerciſe is not ſo good here, as for Expulſion, if the growth of it may not be hindered; for it
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:93369:182"/> rather moves flux of Humours that encreaſe its growth; but moderate and gentle exerciſes are not to be abandoned.</p>
                        <p>2. If grown, to expel it: Here ſuch as are for ejection of the dead Child, and moving of the <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> are uſeful; and ſuch things as are contrary to thoſe uſed for preſervation of the Child in the <hi>

                        <p>Then after Preparation, give Purgers, and things that move the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua,</hi> whereof take this for an Example: ℞ of Borax, Savin, Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and Diptamy of <hi>Creet,</hi> of each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j.

                        <p>Externally are many things to be uſed to relax the parts, and diſcuſs and ſhake off the impacted matter, as are Inſeſſions, Fomentations, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms, Oyntments, Peſſaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of emollient and reſolvent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as Chamomile, Mallows, mariſh Mallows, Mellilot, Mugwort, Dill, Rheu, Motherwort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>Some apply dry Cupping-glaſſes, and painful Ligatures about the Calves of the Legs for attraction ſake.</p>

                        <p>MElancholly of Women is a <hi>Delirium,</hi> and ſadneſs, with pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Mind and Sences, coming by Intervals, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Feaver; made from baſe exhalations from the <hi>Uterus,</hi> affected with a Melancholly Humour, dulling the Animal Spirits.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>CAUSE.</head>
                        <p>Cauſe is Melancholly, and an earthly groſs feculent Humour ſeated in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and there exhaling to the Brain fuliginous melancholly Vapours, which deprave the Animal Spirits, and ſenſitive Faculty, drawing the original of its growth from natural and dry Evacuation in the <hi>Uterus</hi> impedited, as either ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> or retenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Seed, or both, which thereby putrifie.</p>

                        <head>SIGNS DIAGNOSTICK.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. There is fearfulneſs, ſadneſs, unſatisfiedneſs in every thing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of mind, and ſometime raging, anxiety and weeping, they ſleep little.</p>
                        <p>They laugh, dote, talk idley, and are moſt garrulous at ſuch time that the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> might be expected.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Diſtemper of the principal parts, from the Vapours ſent to them and afflicting. As, 1. to the Heart there is made anxiety, ſadneſs, the Arteries of it beat vehemently about the Milt and Back. 2. To the Stomach there is made loathing of Meat, and want of Appetite, ſo that ſometime the Sick thereby are greatly waſted. 3. To the <hi>Thorax</hi> are made great Pains from Vapours tranſmitted by the intercoſtal Arteries, and vellicating the Membranes of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> the ſide alſo, from the Region of the Heart to the left Pap, is often pained. 4. To the Jaws there is made a Senſe of Choaking, and they are much vexed with dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there.</p>

                        <p>'Tis a Diſeaſe of ſome difficulty to cure, both in reſpect, 1. Of the Symptoms it hath with it. 2. Of the parts thereby Afflicted. 3. By reaſon of the ſtubbornneſs, being a cold and dry affect. 4. Of the great danger there is of the Brain being primarily affected, through
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:93369:184"/> long continuance of this Diſeaſe, whenas 'tis very hard (if at all cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to be removed.</p>

                        <head>CURE.</head>
                        <p>Bleeding is firſt to be inſtituted (after an orderly Dyet, as is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the General Chapter of Melancholy) by Bleeding, open the Cubit-Vein firſt; then, if the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> be ſtopt, open the Ankle-Vein ſome days before they are to come down: If Blood be more hot and black according to the <hi>Galenical</hi> Rule, we may more freely draw it out.</p>
                        <p>2. Preparation, and Alteration of the melancholy Humour, is to be made, by Cordials and Specificals for Melancholy; Borage, Bugloſs, Dodder of Time, Balm, Roſemary, Archangel, Woodroof, Violet-Leaves, Vipers Bugloſs, Fumitary, Featherfew, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> boild in Whey clarified, and drunk; or Syrups of the Juyce of Apples, of Dodder of Time, of Borage, and the like, or Julaps of thoſe Syrups and White-Wine, or Cordial diſtilled Waters are good for variety and change, which ſometimes greatly pleaſeth the Sick.</p>
                        <p>3. Purge with ſuch as properly purge Melancholy, and are made friendly to the <hi>Uterus,</hi> by the mixing therewith Specificals to carry the force of the Medicine to operate more ſpecifically upon the <hi>Uterus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If ſhe be Coſtive, help that by often Cliſters. Medicines in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as in Pills, do dry too much, therefore Potions, or purging Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps are preferred; Extract of black Hellebore, of <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> &amp;c. are Medicinal.</p>
                        <p>Venery is very helpful for her, acted moderately and ſeaſonably.</p>
                        <p>Emollient and moiſtening Bathes are good, both to moiſten and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and hinder thick and dry Evaporations, and appeaſe watching; for which, if it be immoderate, we muſt uſe ſomnoriferous Emulſions, Julaps and Applications to her Head, Pomanders to ſmell to; and in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of watching, <hi>Laudanum</hi> to two or three Grains, may be given.</p>
                        <p>Comforters of the Heart, and Cheriſhers of the Spirits, are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to be given, and whatever may avert and turn away Melancholy, and make her chearful.</p>

                     <p>MAny, various and great are the Diſeaſes and Symptoms that ariſe to Women during the time of their going with Child: The firſt, and that happen in the firſt times of her going with Child, is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A Spaſm or Cramp, chiefly vexing the Calf of the Leg, which is eaſed by anointing with Oyl of Bays by the fire, and wrapping an hot woollen Cloth thereupon.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="343" facs="tcp:93369:184"/>2. A <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> or Lientery, wherein the Meat paſſeth through the Body juſt as it was chewed, no alteration being made.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Illiack Paſſion, wherein are great Torments and Belly-pains from the Guts inflamed, and involved one within another, called by ſome <hi>Convolvulus;</hi> and whatſoever here is ſwallowed down, is preſently caſt up again by Vomit, either becauſe it cannot paſs, or becauſe Vapours ariſing herefrom diſturb and evert the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Cure it as a common <hi>Illiack</hi>-Paſſion, reſpecting the Fruit in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and condition of the Woman.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Nauſea,</hi> and Vomiting; This, as in Child-bearing, ſo alſo after Delivery, is very moleſtuous, and ſometime Food, ſometimes onely Humours, if the Stomach be empty, are caſt out.</p>
                     <p>Diſdain of Food is often concomitant herewith, and the Woman nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affecteth the thing ſhe eateth, nor eaten, doth ſhe keep it, or not without great offence.</p>
                     <p>The Stomach is to be ſtrengthened: a clenſing Potion premiſed, give Decoction of Wormwood, Centuary, Mint, Cinnamon, <hi>Enula</hi>-Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if a Decoction be too ſtrong, ſteep them, being aptly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in her Beer; if ſhe diſlike them ſo, from great Weakneſs of her Stomach, compoſe them into a maſs, to be ſwallowed in Pills: give her every night going to Bed the quantity of a Nutmeg, of this or the like Electuary, ℞ <hi>Marmalade</hi> of <hi>Quinces,</hi> ℥ij. Conſerve of Roſes, ℥j. Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, Mace, of each <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. with Syrup of Mint, make it into a due form; Strengtheners and aſtringent Oyntments alſo for the Stomach, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Uſe, are to be uſed.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Womens Longings, and coveting of divers and ſtrange Aliments. See the Cure in the Chapter of Womens Longings.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Belly-ach, from Wind and bad Vapours. 'Tis taken away with Carminatives, and as is directed in the Chapter of Wind from the <hi>Uterus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Toothach.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Headach and <hi>Vertigo,</hi> which alſo are made from filthy exhalations, and unwholſom vapours ſent from the <hi>Uterus</hi> to the Head. See their Cure in the Chapter of them; particularly, 1. Reſpect the Cauſe; 2. The part from whence they ariſe.</p>
                     <p>II. In the middle time of her going with Child, are,</p>
                     <p>1. A Cough; This ariſes, 1. From compreſſure of parts. 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Humours, which putrifie and ſend moleſtuous and irritating vapours to the parts deſtinated for breathing; this ſometime in the laſt Months doth urge moſt; and the reaſon may very well be, becauſe then
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:93369:185"/> a greater quantity of noxious Humours are heaped up, than were at firſt.</p>

                        <p>2. Fainting, panting of the Heart, and Lipothimy, from fuliginous and malignant Vapours communicated from the <hi>Uterus,</hi> whereby the Heart ſtriving to expel thoſe exhalations, doth frequently ſtretch and contract it ſelf.</p>

                        <p>In Cure, Diverſion of the Vapours, after a Lenitive, is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured; Frictions of the lower parts, Ligatures, Cuppers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are convenient; give her Balm-Water, Syrup of Mint, with other Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: If this doth no good, breathing the <hi>Baſilick</hi> Vein is ſometimes very helpful, both to refreſh the Heart, and the Infant too, being almoſt ſtrangled from the great quantity and bad quality of humorous Blood; yet we do it with ſome moderation, and ſuppoſing the Woman be young, fleſhy and ſtrong.</p>
                        <p>3. Pain of the Loins and Hips. See its Cure in the general Chapter of Pain, in our Chyrurgery.</p>
                        <p>4. Swelling of the Legs; this proceeds from abundance of groſs cold Humours, through redundancy of them in the Body, being thruſt down thither; this happens alſo in the laſt Months of her going with Child, they are ſcarce perfectly healed till they be delivered; yet in the mean time we are not to procraſtinate the Cure, leſt from the part too much weakened, and the Humour by long being ſeated there, growing more contumacious, a worſe Caſe befal afterward, and it be harder to be cured. 1. We muſt go about Diſcuſſion, and Diſſolution of the Humours and ſwelling. 2. Strengthen the part. If by the coldneſs of
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:93369:185"/> the part we fear a Gangrene, 'tis prevented by ſcarifying of the part, for ſo 'tis ventilated, and putrifaction impedited.</p>
                        <p>5. An Haemorrage of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> or Haemorrhoid-Veins, ſending out Blood either from too great plenty of it, made from abounding of it in the whole Body, or weakneſs of the Birth, not attracting that that is ſent thither for its nouriſhment, or prave Humours ſtimulating the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultrice force of the <hi>Uterus.</hi>

Swelling and puffing up of the Veins from groſs and flatulent Blood; Phlebotomy, or opening a Vein, becauſe it detracts nouriſhment from the Child, is not allowed: We muſt palliate, and keep a good Dyet till time of Delivery, for then theſe Affects are wont to be diſſolved.</p>
                        <p>4.

                        </p>

                        <p>Secondly, In Dyet; which belongs to external Cauſes; but of that we have already ſpoken.</p>

                        <p>Thirdly, From violent Cauſes; which, 1. Either cauſe ſolution of continuity, or too great concuſſion and ſhaking of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> as is ſnee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, jumping, leaping, running, dancing, blows, falls, and the like.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Vehement vexings, diſquietings, chidings, anger, wrath, perturbation of the Mind and Senſes.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, Sudden frightings, ſwooning, failing of the Spirits, the noiſe of a Gun, clap of Thunder, and the like, do ſometime cauſe, and much further abortion.</p>

                        <head>SIGNS DIAGNOSTICK.</head>
                        <p>Signs preceding Abortion, are, 1. A leſſening of the Nipples and Paps extenuated, which ſhews the want of Blood in the Veins of the <hi>Uterus,</hi> and of the Paps, or that through violence of the Birth, or rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Veſſels, the Blood is ruſhed into the <hi>Uterus,</hi> from the Veins of the Paps; for then the Paps that were full and plump before, ſlack, and become lank and ſmall: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaith, <hi>If a Woman hath Twins, and one be a Wench, and the other a Boy; if the right Breſt is ſuddenly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſhe loſeth her Boy; and if the left, her Girl.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Much Milk flowing from the Nipples.</p>
                        <p>3. Pains about the Belly and Loins, which end about the Share, and <hi>Os Sacrum;</hi> 2. About the Region of the Reins, deſcending to the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogaſter,</hi> chiefly ariſing from Cold; 3. Painful Throes.</p>
                        <p>4. The Child is fallen down lower then duely it ought, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultrice faculty is mightily provoked to caſt it forth.</p>
                        <p>5. There flows out a thin watery and bloody evacuation from the <hi>Uterus;</hi> or <hi>Menſtrua</hi> being black, and Throes accompanying, certainly denote Abortion near.</p>
                        <p>6. If in acute and dangerous Diſeaſes ſhe happens to be in Travel, both ſhe and the Child too, are uſually killed thereby.</p>
                        <p>7. Shakings of the parts, and trembling motion, and redneſs of the Face, and a diſturbance in her Body, are ſometimes Foretellers and Forerunners of Abortion.</p>

                        <p>Cure is altogether preventive, in which, 1. We muſt reſpect the Cauſe, which if it be from Phlethory, letting Blood is rather to be done then refuſed. <hi>Fernelius</hi> aſſerting, that unleſs a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood be drawn out before that ſhe looks for Delivery, the Child will be overwhelmed and ſuffocated with plenty of Blood, which may fall out of the Veins into the <hi>Uterns,</hi> they opening through fulneſs: ſome bid a Vein to be cut before Conception. 2. If <hi>Cacochymy</hi> offends, we muſt purge, and take away the irritating Cauſe, and temper Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 3. The Bowels muſt be corroborated, the retentive faculty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, Diſtemper corrected, and things hurtful avoided; all which prevent well, if uſed before conception.</p>

                        <p>In too great moiſture, Sweating and Dryers are uſeful; in Drineſſe, Moiſtners and Nouriſhers. Precaution before Conception, by fitting the Body, and freeing it from all infirmities, is as uſeful as defending it, when it is conceived, from Death and Miſcarriage.</p>
                        <p>Before Abortion is nigh, theſe Medicines are good Preſervatives. 1. Sage-Ale drunk every morning, or Cinnamon boild in Beer. 2. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Potabile,</hi> which ſtrengthening Nature in her Center, fortifies all Parts. 3. Juyce of Lobſters given twice a Month in Wine, or the Salt of them, are good Preſervatives againſt Abortion.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>CAUSES.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. The Cauſe is not certainly natural, ſay Divines, but the Hand of GOD miraculouſly effecting it, as ſometimes it is; One Woman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the many Mouths ſhe had to feed, <hi>viz.</hi> her Children, brought forth a Child without a Mouth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Aſtrologers refer it to the Stars, and poſition of the Moon in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient degrees at time of Conception.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Cauſe is Imagination of the Woman at time of Conception, diligently applying the ſight of thoſe things ſhe ſaw, to her ſelf: Hence
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:93369:191"/> it is that ſome, having looked and pondered upon the fight of a ravenous Bird called <hi>Harpa,</hi> have brought forth ſuch a one: Another brought forth a <hi>Negro,</hi> looking upon the Picture of a <hi>Negro</hi> that hung in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at time of Conception: A Woman at <hi>Piſa</hi> is reported to have brought forth a Child all hairy, like a Camel, becauſe ſhe uſed to bow eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to the Image of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> cloathed in Camels Hair: Some Women in ſeeing an Hare, bring forth a Child with an Hare-Lip: One Woman ſeeing a Boy at time of Conception with two Thumbs, brought forth a Boy alſo on both hands double Thumb'd, as was the Boy ſhe ſaw: Another Woman at time of Conception ſeeing a Child that had a great Head, from Water gathered in it, called <hi>Hydrocephalus,</hi> or a Dropſie of the Head, brought forth a Child with a great Head alſo, that was ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the skin puffed up, but not filled with Water. As Women, ſo alſo Sheep are thus affected from the ſtrength of the imaginatrice facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at time of Conception; for <hi>Jacob</hi> laying peeled Rods in the Gutter where they were to drink, they brought forth parti-coloured Lambs: Women that ſeriouſly and deeply think of the ill-ſhapen Members they ſee in others, conceive and bring forth Children ſo miſ-figured; alſo 'tis very bad for Women at time of Conception to ſee Pictures on a wall, or Images, for fear they bring forth Children of like conformation. Some think that Children are like the Mothers true Husband, that are got by another, becauſe the Woman was in fear when they were got, and ſo conceived by the imagination alike: But, ſay they, If the ſame man get them when the Woman is not in fear, but ſecure, and her Husband far from home, the Child will have the likeneſs of its true Father or Begetter, becauſe the Mothers Mind doth the Child diſpoſe.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, ſome, according to the Vulgar Stories, having been ſtruck with a piece of Fleſh, the Child hath had the Mark of that piece of meat in the ſame place that the Woman was ſtruck in; and ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtruck a Woman with a Mouſe on the Cheek, ſhe hath brought forth a Child repreſenting the figure of a Mouſe on its Cheek: And why may not feeling, as well as ſeeing, move the imaginatrice faculty to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect theſe?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A Cauſe of many being born Crook-Back'd, great-Headed, from abundance of Humours, or full of running ſores, or leprous, may be from the <hi>Act</hi> of copulation done at ſuch time as ſhe had her <hi>Menſtrua</hi> on her.</p>

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:93369:191"/> Nature ſtriving always to beget her like: So Men coupling with Bruits beget Monſters, half a Man, and half a Beaſt; and hence perhaps it came that ſome People are horned, wild, and live on Graſs, Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe forms moſt ſhew them to be Men; ſome alſo have Tails as Beaſts, and many are variouſly formed, as if there was a form made equally concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Mans and Beaſts; ſometimes the fore parts are like a Man, and the hinder repreſent a Beaſtial Form. 2.

                        <p>Cauſes of <hi>Quotidian</hi> Agues is aſcribed to Flegm putrified or rotted in the Miſeraick Veins, or firſt Region of the Body. Others allot the place of putrifaction in Intermitting Feavers, to be in the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> and Bowels nouriſhed therefrom.</p>
                        <p>All things that cauſe encreaſe of flegm, may be cauſe hereof, chiefly a weak heat of the Stomach and Bowels, cold and moiſt Aliments, or too great plenty of them, together with long ſleep, a Sedentary Life, Idleneſs, Winter time, old Age, and Childhood, wherein it chiefly happens.</p>

                        <p>2. Signs of flegm abounding, and a going before of ſuch things that engendred Flegm. Signs of a flegmatick or pituitous habit of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be, a bulky fat Body, a ſluggiſh Diſpoſition, and dull Senſes; Dreams of Waters, and dull Actions, white and pale colour of Face, profound ſleeps, weak Memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. From the time of its invaſion, which is chiefly on Nights, which is the worſe, becauſe that time is deſigned by Nature for reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment.</p>
                        <p>4. From the manner of the fit, wherein cold is not felt great in the firſt fits, but encreaſes by degrees, and comes like a cooling without ſhaking, ſometimes a light horrour, whenas the matter is more benign, only troubles: Heat at firſt appears not ſharp but airy, and augments
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:93369:197"/> but ſlowly, not is it called back with force and violence to the inward parts, as in a <hi>Tertian</hi> Feaver; and ſometimes cold, ſometimes heat is perceived, but with holding their hand on them longer, in their heat ſharpneſs is alſo perceived.</p>
                        <p>5. From the Urine, which in the beginning is white, thin and crude, but in the proceſs more thick and troubled, and often ruddy, when as the matter is concocted.</p>
                        <p>6. From the Pulſe, which in the beginning is inordinate, and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, weak and ſlow, nor in the augmentation and encreaſe of the Ague is the Pulſe changed much, either in celerity or ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>7. From Sweats, which in the firſt fits is ſcarce reckonable, nor is it much afterward.</p>
                        <p>8. From Symptoms: Where obſerve, 1. that Thirſt is not intenſe, but very little or none. 2. Difflation and puffing up of the Middriff. 3. Decoloration of the Face, which is not red, but duskiſh, and puffed up. 4. Their Vomitings, Stools, ſleeping and inappetence, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the redundancy of Flegm. 5. They do not ceaſe in a perfect inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, for ſometimes the fit laſts twelve hours, and ſometimes twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours, and it appears continual.</p>

                        <p>It differs from variety of the Nature of flegm putrified, for if flegm be glazen, or vitreat, or acid, then they have invaſions with rigour, and the ſick is Feaveriſh and cold both together; becauſe half the offending Humour is putrified, whence comes the heat, and the other half is not putrified, and thence cold ſhaking moleſts, and this is called, <hi>Epiala Febria.</hi>

                        <p>2. It never invades young Men, or ſuch as are hot, dry, and Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick by Nature, but thoſe that are of a moiſt and flegmatick Temper,

                     <p>Sometimes outward Cauſes bring Agues without inward, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Inward Cauſes produce Agues without the progreſs of Outward, Obvious, and Procatarctick Cauſes; but commonly Agues are made by ſome outward Cauſe, operating upon the inward, and where in any Bowel, there is a previous conſimiler Diſpoſition, a ſlight outward Cauſe doth more, then in a firm conſtitution of the Inward Bowels great outward Cauſes may do; unleſs the Patient is fit to receive the operation of the Agent, and the Agent in all things able and appoſite to operate upon the Patient, little or nothing is done: Some catch Agues, ſpecially <hi>Quartanes,</hi> at fall of the Leaf, commonly by leaving off Garments, ſtanding in Water, or eating Apples, or cold Drink and Water, or otherwiſe by taking cold; and ſome do all theſe, and they do cauſe in them another Diſtemper different from theſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from each other; and others wade in cold Water, drink cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eat Apples, go naked Breaſted, Wet-ſhod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and feel no harm at all; and ſome are ſo by Nature, more or leſs, and ſome by cuſtom, and ſome by both; and he that will know Truth, all the Truth, and no other or more then the Truth, muſt come to Critical Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for we ſhall rarely find two alike; yet commonly they that have A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues alike every fourth day (which the Vulgar call Third-day-Agues, not reckoning the two Fit-dayes, but one) have commonly Symptoms more alike one another, then like thoſe that have Agues every other or, each day: And as theſe things we have written differ one from another, ſo ſome other things we have not written may differ from theſe.</p>
                     <p>And there be many things to be conſidered: the courſe of the Stars at each mans firſt ſicking, and the alteration of them; and that Planet that was upon the Aſcendent at a Nativity, hath great ſignification; and the Moon which cauſes great alteration, greatly alters in Place and Aſpect. Alſo the natural conſtitution of our Bodies, Clymates, and

                     <p>VVHere-ever there is a Feaver equal, not violent, ſeated in the habit of the Body, I ſuppoſe it proper to be called an <hi>Hectick.</hi> The queſtion in moſt Diſeaſes is chiefly what one or two or three Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms do of neceſſity concur to make it properly ſo called, without which it is improper ſo to call it; for ſome have lingring Feavers with ſome ſenſible fits, and ſome have violent Feavers without them; ſome are almoſt conſtantly diſtempered with heat like Feavers, and yet have now and than cold fits, like Agues; ſome that have Feaveriſh Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, have no other concomitant Symptoms of an <hi>Hectick;</hi> and ſome have the waſting and dryneſs aſcribed to <hi>Hecticks,</hi> and yet no ſenſible Feaver, and if not ſenſible, not to be called ſo; and ſome have a thirſt without dryneſs, and dryneſs without thirſt; and ſome ſeem dry in one part or particular, and moiſt in another part or particular; ſo that Nature varies ſomewhat in all, and much in moſt: and almoſt all Sickneſs hath ſome changes, but ſcarce any all; neither is waſting of the Lungs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with a waſting of the Fleſh; or if it be, it is not always in the ſame meaſure and manner; nor is the waſting of the Lungs alone the cauſe of the waſting of the Fleſh, but the waſting of other Bowels alſo may waſte the Fleſh; but it is ſometimes hard to ſay whether a part waſted cauſeth waſting of the Body; or that that cauſed waſting of the Body, cauſed alſo the waſting of that part or parts: Nor are all <hi>Hecticks</hi> (if it is proper to call any ſo) mild at firſt, and hotter in proceſs of time, but ſome naturally grow cooler, that uſed to be hot; and ſome naturally grow hot, ſome by fits, and ſome more conſtantly, ſome leſs, and ſome more, that uſed to be always cool: There is ſcarce any thing, a ſtaid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgmented-man and well read, can imagine, but he may find or read of in ſome: There is nothing may happen to all, but every thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to ſome; every thing was ordained to keep its order, as well to the frequency, as violence of its actions; but from the one extreme of a thing to the other, is much variety; and complicated Cauſes produce complicated Effects: All things were contrived methodically of GOD, but fall out in an accidental and various manner, as to our Knowledge, and meerly contingent, as to our Foreknowledge.</p>
                     <p>Some <hi>Hecticks</hi> are incurable, and ſome be curable; and amongſt thoſe one is cured the firſt month, another the ſecond, and ſo onward; one
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:93369:201"/> the firſt year, another in the ſecond, another in the third, and ſo may the variety of Nature in other things be gueſſed; one is cured by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, another by Medicine; one by a Method of Phyſick, another with one or two Specificals; and of theſe, one with Snails, another with Frogs boiled in Milk or Broath; One with Gellies, another with Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſome with Syrup of Walnuts, and ſome with Aſſes; and ſome uſe all theſe things, and are not cured; and ſome none, and yet are; yet GOD commonly appoints the Effects, by ordering the Cauſe: But in many Medicines we give, we are not ſure which doth it, or whether Nature might not have done the like, or whether this and the other cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alike, had their Diſeaſe cauſed alike in the inward parts.</p>
                     <p>And in this manner doth Nature proceed in other Sickneſſes; and as theſe vary from one another, ſo probably may others vary from theſe; but we endeavoured to write all ſuch things as experience, and men may prove them by what they ſhall ſee clearly and plainly in their Practices.

                        <p>Cure, Is firſt by a good Dyet, wherein we muſt avoid all ſalt ſharp binding things; exerciſing of Venery is very bad, and alſo Wine. 2. Reſpecting the Cauſe, correct bad Aliment. 3. Medicines moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are to be uſed for drineſs. 4. Attracters of the good Humours mixt with Aſtringents to fortifie the Skin, both bringing a good Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive Humour, and making good the faculty of the Skin, producing Hair.</p>
                        <p>An Unguent of <hi>Labdanum,</hi> Oyl of Maſtick, and Puple of Fenugreek-Seeds may ſerve to theſe intentions; cutting of the Hair often is very good, for ſo being ſhorter, it requires the leſs moiſture, and grows thicker.</p>
                        <p>Medicines by a Propriety avail againſt Baldneſs, and bring again Hairs where they are wanting; as Froath of the Sea is ſaid, by waſhing of a bald Head decently and comelity, to deck it with Hairs; the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of a Whetſtone mixed with Oyl, is good; the Juyce of Onions, anointed for many times together (in the Sun, ſay ſome) upon the bald place, is very effectual to bring the Hair again; the Roots of <hi>Jacinths</hi> are ſaid to procure Hair in Beardleſs Men; as alſo that the Aſhes of Southernwood, mixt with Oyl of Radiſh or Organy, will quickly cauſe the Beard to grow.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>CAUSE.</head>
                        <p>Cauſe is an hot and dry Diſtemper of the Skin, which converts a ſharp and thin Humour that inſinuates it ſelf, and breaths through it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſcurf.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond Opinion is, That the Cauſe is in <hi>Ichorus</hi> Juyce, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding the thin Skin, and drying, doth ſtir up certain Scales and Scurf.</p>
                        <p>A third Opinion is, That they are Humours, either Serous, Chollick or Flegmatick, carried with the nouriſhment of the Hairs thither, and the thinner Parts being diſcuſt, the thicker remain about the Roots of the Hair, and turn to a ſcurfey matter, being attracted by a more hot Brain.</p>

                        <p>A fourth Opinion is, That they are made, 1. From thickneſs and aſtriction of the Parts. 2. From an Humour aduſt, and therefore get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a drying and eroding quality, and therefore cleaves and dries the Cuticle or outward Skin, effecting an Ulcerous temper of it, and ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of continuity; for from an Humour muſt needs be moiſture; from Eroſion, Ulcers; and from Drying, Scurfs; but theſe Humours are made from bad Nouriſhment aforegoing.</p>

                        <p>Cauſe is, 1. Putrid Humours collected 'twixt the Cuticle, and true Skin, not very ſharp, and reſiding moſt in the Emunctories, and hot moiſt places that have hair to cover them, and for them to abide in.</p>
                        <p>2. The frequent uſe of Figs is condemned by many; the reaſon is thought to be from a quality in them turning to ſuch an Excrement that the Lice are bred of; the frequent uſe of Vipers are alſo thought by their tenuity to effect the breeding of Lice, thereby expelling many Humours to the Skin; alſo other bad things, as Fruits, that are apt to corrupt much further.</p>
                        <p>3. Though a good Dyet be kept, and the Parties be not of flegmatick
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:93369:210"/> and moiſt tempers, for in ſuch they chiefly breed, and therefore more in Childhood than in elder Age; yet to ſuch as lie in Camps long with their Cloaths unſhifted, abundance of them are bred; and thoſe that are of ſuch apter tempers to breed them, by often ſhifting, and keeping their Cloaths clean, and combing, do preſerve themſelves from them.</p>
                        <p>4. They grow exceedingly by the immoderate uſe of Waters, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or by moiſtening Cauſes; therefore Children are moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and Women more than Men, excepted the Head, for Womens Heads being cloſe bound up always, Nouriſhes them not ſo much.</p>
                        <p>5. The fifth Cauſe is, by catching; one louſie Body may infect a whole Company, as <hi>One ſcabbed Sheep infects a whole Flock:</hi> The Vulgar ſay they fly in <hi>May,</hi> which thing Experience hath verified to ſome; yet are no Wings to be perceived, unleſs they grow then.</p>

                        <p>2. Internal Dryers, becauſe from plenty of humidity they ariſe.</p>
                        <p>3. Topicks, are either to be drying and cleanſing, or diſcuſſing and drying, as others will; here Baths, Tubs and Lotions of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Head are conducible, made of bitter things, and Relaxers or Opners of the Pores, that the Humors, the matter of which Lice are made, may breath forth, therefore add ſome Penetraters; yet ſome fear there is, leſt by too much and too long Bathing, Excrements ſhould be more gathered to the Skin; whenas Lice proceed from the whole Body, elſe bathing of the whole Body is not uſeable; let a Tub or Bath be prepared of Niter, Hellebore, Cal-mint, Salt, Collocinthis, Stapheſacre, the Berry of <hi>India,</hi> called <hi>Coculus Indi,</hi> and other bitter and ſalt things boiled in Sea-water.</p>
                        <p>A Lee of the Flower of Golden <hi>Staechas,</hi> or Cedar-wood, Tamarisk, Broom, Hyſſop, and Engliſh Tobacco boild in ſalt-water, by a propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety kill all manner of Lice and Nits; the diſtilled water of the Bead-Tree of <hi>Capadocia,</hi> alſo doth the like.</p>
                        <p>The Oyl made by Decoction or Inſolation of the Flowers of the Broom Buſh, the ſtronger 'tis made, the more effectual it is to kill Lice in all parts of the Body.</p>
                        <p>Or a Liniment of the Oyl extracted from Muſtard-Seed, Oyl of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, <hi>ana ℥ſs.</hi> Pouder of the white Roots of Hellebore, of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bark of the black Alder Tree, <hi>ana ℥ſs. Hyſſop,</hi> 
                           <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. Vinegar, as much as may ſuffice; the vulgar remedy for Lice is <hi>Coculus Indi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Emunctories alſo are to be anointed, becauſe there by reaſon of the Veins more frequenting, more of the matter and heat is preſent; an Oyntment of <hi>Olibanum</hi> and Barrows Greaſe is greatly commended, both to kill them, and hinder their breeding again.</p>

                        <p>The Garments alſo are to be waſhed in proper Lee, as in the Lee of the Aſhes of Broom, and Flowers of <hi>Stachados</hi> of a Golden Colour, or ſprinkled with the Pouder of <hi>Stapheſacre</hi> and Saffron; if they be only in the Head, Pouders there may be ſprinkled, where Oyntments ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are not ſo commodious or convenient, by reaſon of daubing the Hair; this then among others may ſerve for a ſpecial Example, ℞ Aſhes of Broom, of <hi>Coculus Indi</hi> Berries, white <hi>Hellebore</hi> and <hi>Stapheſacre, ana.</hi> ℥j.

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>DIFFERENCE.</head>
                        <p>Difference is four-fold. 1. Lice, which are white, bred external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all parts of the Body, creeping, and by biting, moving a little Itch, and are not very hurtful, unleſs the parts be ulcerated, or they exceed in number, of which we have treated largely; they are called <hi>Pediculi,</hi> from their many Feet.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Morpiones,</hi> are more flat, commonly bred in the Share, called by <hi>Ariſtotle, Ferum Ahimale;</hi> and by the Vulgar Latins, <hi>Pedicolatae, Peſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latae</hi> and <hi>Morpiones,</hi> they wander not as the Lice do, but ſtick faſt to the Skin, and gnaw much; of their Cauſe and Cure, ſee the precedent Cauſe and Cure of Lice in General.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>Chirones,</hi> which never break forth of the Skin, but alwayes lie hid within the Skin and Fleſh, and there Corrode; chiefly they are in the Hands, and through negligence breed there, are cauſed of a more dry Humour then Lice, that penetrates and breathes not forth through the Pores of the Skin: ſome Women uſe to pull theſe <hi>Chirones</hi> out of the Fleſh with a Needle, but the Cauſe not being taken away, they return again. Stupifying things that hinder the ſenſe, and dull their biting, are good, as is Juyce of Henbane; but leſt that ſhould bring trembling to the Hands, the Oyl of the Seed is more wholfom; Alſo 'tis very good to dip the Hand in Salt and Vinegar, and rub the part where they are, which kills them, and their Itching is taken away; Alſo Foments of ſalt-water, or Vinegar of Henbane and Salt are effectual. But of all Remedies, the moſt effectual is Quickſilver for Unction of the Parts affected, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killed and mixed into an Oyntment with Greaſe, Oyl of Bayes and Sope: for all Remedies failing, this ſometimes alone will deſtroy all kinds of Lice, <hi>Morpions, Chyrones,</hi> Nits, and Fleas that ſuck the Body for nouriſhment, but 'tis not ſo ſafe as others, ſpecially for the Head, to
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:93369:211"/> be anointed on the Sutures or Ulcers, for therefrom come dangerous effects oftentimes, ſpecially to Children.</p>
                        <p>Some have found theſe <hi>Chirones</hi> in the Membranes of the Eyes, or <hi>Adnata,</hi> which are very aptly with a fine Needle to be picked out, and the Eye waſhed with healing Eye-Waters, and that eaſe the pain and itching cauſed by them.</p>
                        <p>4. Nits, called <hi>Leudes</hi> by the Latins, there is a near familiarity 'twixt them and Lice; for Heads that are very louſie, are alſo very full of Nits, they are leaſt of all the kinds, ſticking very faſt to the Hair, and are confined to the Head, or very ſeldom elſewhere; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are found under the Skin, and then they cauſe much itch and troubling pricking; they are deſtroyed as Lice, and what are proper for them, are proper for theſe; the Hair is preſerved from nouriſhing Nits, or their generation is prohibited by a Lee made of the Aſhes of Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed, or Cottenwood, and of Tamarisk.</p>

                        <head>CAUSE.</head>
                        <p>The Cauſe is held by ſome to be a pituitous viſcous matter, by others a mixtion of thick Flegm and Melancholy, by others a flegmatick or melancholy Humour hardened: <hi>Platerus</hi> ſaith, <hi>'Tis an Earthy Juyce har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened; Riolanus</hi> ſaith, <hi>A portion of the fat being hardened in ſome places, make a Scirrhous Tumour, and ſometime Strumons: Sennertus</hi> ſaith, <hi>They are made of ſlow and thick matter, vulgarly termed Flegm, to which Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly is adjoyned; and if otherwiſe they were cauſed from other Humours, they would not be ſo durable, but would rot.</hi> Theſe Humours are carried with the proper Juyce deſtinated for the Nouriſhment of the Glandules, which is thought by quantity to offend, as well as quality; whenas the Glandules have more then ſufficient, the reſt becomes excrementitious, and acquires a peculiar nature. In quality that matter may offend, as Phlegmatick, Melancholick, and Faeculent, which excrementitiouſly ſent (and caſt off by Nature, as unfit Nouriſhment) to thoſe parts, Nature there provides a Bag, or Membrane, as her Store-houſe, for laying up ſuch Excrements that do her hurt, if ſhe ſhould make uſe of.</p>
                        <p>The primitive and antecedent Cauſe is more certain, as crude and thick Meats, unwholeſome Waters, as thoſe of the <hi>Alps,</hi> thoſe alſo that are in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Carinthia,</hi> containing <hi>Mercury</hi> in them; crude Aliments, Snow-Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taken, are ſometimes pregreſſive; but Mine-Waters, eſpecially of Quickſilver, are thought to endue the Humour with ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar a quality; and the admixtion of Melancholy herewith, ſometimes make it degenerate cancrous; Contuſion ſometimes gives occaſion to it.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>SIGNS DIAGNOSTICKS.</head>
                        <p>The Kings Evil is a ſcirrhous Tumour of the Glandules, ſhut up in a peculiar Skin or Membrane; theſe Tumours are many, and take deep root; this Humour ſometimes poſſeſſes all the Kernels, whereby they are all tumified; it ſometimes is found in the inward Bowels; they are round and pendulous, yeilding not to touch, but moveable, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times painful.</p>
                        <pb n="400" facs="tcp:93369:213"/>
                        <p>They are ſometimes onely in the two Glandules under the inferiour Jaw-Bone, ſometime in the Arm-holes, and ſometimes throughout the whole Body where there be Glandules: Some ſay, If it be the Kings Evil, lay a live Earth-worm over-night upon it, and lay upon her a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock-Leaf; and if in the morning ſhe be dead, 'tis; elſe not the Kings Evil.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The Membrane or Bladder it is included in, is like that of <hi>Atheroma,</hi> and <hi>Steatoma;</hi> from its formatrix faculty 'tis never idle: for when it is filled, diſtended, and then hath poured out matter, as if the Tumour was ſuppurated, it doth attain a certain knitting up, contexture, or compoſure again, as if a new Membrane; ſome take it for ſubalbeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Fleſh, diſtending and encreaſing from a matter ſoaked in, having a forming faculty from a peculiar quality.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. Some are benign, well-qualitied, round, without great pain, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or inflamation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Others are contrary to theſe, and of a malignant quality, very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, hard, pulſant, and inflamed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Some are Cancrous, poſſeſſing all the Glandules.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Some are more deep, others more ſuperficial.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Some are accidental, others hereditary from Seed, and the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix faculty in the <hi>Uterus,</hi> according to <hi>Platerus</hi> his opinion.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Some more dangerous, others more ſlight and extern.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Some are movable, others immovable.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Some are outward, poſſeſſing ſometimes the great, ſometimes the leſs Veſſels; ſome have been found in the Bowels and inward parts, ſeventy in the Meſentery together; but whether theſe Tumours poſſeſs the Bowels as they do the outward Glandules, is doubtful, and ſeems not to be credited.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It differs from <hi>Bronchocele,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Gutturis,</hi> for that ſticks out in the fore-part of the Neck, or is a ſwelling forth in the large ſpace of the Throat; ſtruck, it gives a ſound; and cruſhed by the fingers, it ſinks, and ſuddenly riſes again, which is not ſo in <hi>Struma;</hi> yet the the <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Cures</hi> of a Throat-Rupture and the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> are often the ſame.</p>

                           <hi>Platerus</hi> makes a difference between <hi>Scrofula</hi> and <hi>Struma,</hi> ſaying, That <hi>Scrofulae</hi> ſticks out like Grapes, two or three in one Glandule; but <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> he ſaith, be great and pendent Tumours in the Throat, often deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded and raiſe ſhort breathing or impediment therein, and hoarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                        <p>Whoſe Signs are theſe; It is a tumour ſtretched forth, exerciſing a large capacity, ſtruck, it gives a ſound, gives place to preſſing of the Fingers, but riſes to its wonted height again ſuddenly, which is not ſo in the following Differences; but herein a coherence of the Differences is made, for that the Original of a <hi>Bronchocele,</hi> is allowed to be an eary matter, firſt inſinuating it ſelf there, and diſtending; to which other
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:93369:216"/> humours are gathered, which are known by proper Signs.</p>
                        <p>As, 2.

                        <p>Another refers a kind of <hi>Anenriſm,</hi> which is uncureable; ſo are thoſe that come from the Birth and Infancy, thoſe that are great Scirrhous and Cancrous, repleat with many great melancholly Veins, are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and not to be medled withal.</p>
                        <p>A third kind is <hi>Sarcocele,</hi> or a fleſhly Rupture, Sirrhous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains all the life time, unleſs maturely helped, which it is very hard to be; the Cauſes may be ſuch as cauſed <hi>Phlegmatocele;</hi> it is Cronical, and diſcerned by touch and ſight.</p>
